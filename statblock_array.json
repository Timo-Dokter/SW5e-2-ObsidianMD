If the creature does so, it can't see Abeloth until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the target's hit point maximum is reduced to 0, it dies and its essence is absorbed into Abeloth.\n>\n> ***Beguiling Will.*** Abeloth exerts its will on one creature it can see within 120 feet.

While Abeloth has a creature charmed in this way, it can't use any of its Will actions until the effect ends. The effect lasts until the start of Abeloth's next turn, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a power).\n>\n> ***Insane Will.*** Abeloth exerts its will on one creature it can see within 120 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overcome with insanity. While under this effect, a creature can't take reactions and must roll a d8 at the start of its turn to determine its behavior for that turn. On a roll of a 1, the creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take any actions that turn. On a 2-6, the creature doesn't move and takes no actions that turn. On a 7-8, the creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing that turn.

On subsequent turns, the aqua monster can use its Whirlpool action again to maintain and move the whirlpool up to 30 feet in any direction along the surface of the water. The whirlpool sucks up any medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone. A creature must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw when it enters the whirlpool's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. A creature takes 27 (6d8) kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlpool until the power ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlpool, the creature is pulled 5 feet deeper inside it, unless the creature is at the bottom. A restrained creature moves with the whirlpool and is submerged when the effect ends, unless the creature has some means to stay afloat. A restrained creature can use an action to make a DC 21 Strength or Dexterity check. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlpool and is hurled 3d6x10 feet away from it in a random direction. The whirlpool lasts for one round. The aqua monster can repeat the legendary action again to maintain the whirlpool. ",
