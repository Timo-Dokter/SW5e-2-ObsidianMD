For berserkers of the Addicted Approach, substances cause their fury to burn stronger and deeper, granting significant benefits.\r\n\r\n### Slythmonger Savvy\r\n_**Addicted Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in your choice of brewer's kit or spicer's kit. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid the low or addiction to substances. Lastly, you can consume substances as a bonus action, and when you do so, you can also enter a rage as a part of this same bonus action.\r\n\r\n### Freedom Through Slavery\r\n_**Addicted Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nWhile you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have advantage on saving throws that would force you to act against your will, be frightened, or prevent you from attacking a creature. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you are instead immune to effects that would force you to act against your will or would prevent you from attacking a creature.\r\n\r\n### Release the Beast\r\n_**Addicted Approach:** 6th level_\r\nWhile you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a Hit Die to deal additional damage to the target. Roll the Hit Die, adding the result of the die to the damage roll. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you also add your Constitution modifier to the damage roll.\r\n\r\n### Seeing Sound\r\n_**Addicted Approach:** 10th level_\r\nWhile you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you instead have blindsight with a range of 30 feet. If you would already have blindsight, it instead increases by 5 feet or 15 feet, respectively.\r\n\r\n### Fuel the Rampage\r\n_**Addicted Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhile you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.\r\n\r\n## Armored Approach\r\n\r\nMany berserkers forgo armor and rely on their own fortitude. Berserkers of the Armored Approach, however, embrace the use of armor. Each one customizes their own suit of armor to be used both defensively and offensively, so that the suit becomes an extension of the berserker's own might and fury.\r\n\r\n### Spiked Armor\r\n_**Armored Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in armormech's implements. Over the course of a long rest, you can customize a suit of light or medium armor into spiked armor. You must have the armor and armormech's implements in order to perform this modification. You can only have one suit of spiked armor at a time.\r\n\r\nThis armor gains the barbed (1d4) property. If the armor already has the barbed property, the barbed damage increases by one step (from d4 to d6, or from d6 to d8). Additionally, while raging, you add your rage damage bonus to your barbed damage when you successfully initiate or maintain a grapple.\r\n\r\nWhile wearing your spiked armor, you can use your Constitution modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when determining your AC.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while wearing your spiked armor, you can use your spiked armor as an improvised weapon. When you do so, you are considered proficient with it, and if your armor's barbed damage would be higher than your damage with improvised weapons, you use the barbed damage instead. If you take the Attack action on your turn and make at least one attack with your spiked armor, you can use your bonus action to make an additional attack with your spiked armor against the same target.\r\n\r\n### Environmental Shielding\r\n_**Armored Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYou customize your spiked armor to better protect you. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic. While wearing your spiked armor, you have resistance to damage of the chosen type. Over the course of a long rest, you can select a different damage type, provided you have the armor and armormech's implements with you.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while wearing your spiked armor, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme heat or cold.\r\n\r\n### Customized Armor\r\n_**Armored Approach:** 10th level_\r\nYou learn new ways to customize your spiked armor. Choose one of the following options. While wearing your spiked armor, you gain the effects of the chosen option. Over the course of a long rest, you can select a different option, provided you have the armor and armormech's implements with you.\r\n\r\n#### Defensive Field\r\nOn your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 + your berserker level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Deflective Layer\r\nYour armor class increases by 1.\r\n\r\n#### Grappling Line\r\nYou can use a bonus action to launch a grappling line at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line towards you. If it ends this movement within 5 feet of you, it takes kinetic damage from your armor spikes equal to your Strength modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Integrated Sonar\r\nYou can use an action to give yourself the benefits of the *true sight* force power for 1 hour. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Neural Interface\r\nYou are immune to all effects that would cause you to be charmed or frightened.\r\n\r\n### Spiked Retribution\r\n_**Armored Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhen a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes kinetic damage equal to your Strength modifier, as long as you are wearing your spiked armor and you aren't incapacitated.\r\n\r\nIf you are raging, you add your rage damage bonus &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to this damage.\r\n\r\n## Beastmaster Approach\r\n\r\nMany berserkers feel a primal attunement to nature. For berserkers of the Beastmaster Approach, that attunement manifests itself in bestial marks and manifestations that grant the berserker newfound abilities.\r\n\r\n### Bestial Fury\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nWhile raging, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, once on each of your turns while raging, you can mark a creature you can see as your prey for the duration of your rage (no action required). When you do so, once per turn when you deal damage to the creature with a weapon attack, you deal an additional 1d4 damage of the same type. Once per turn when the creature deals damage to you with a weapon attack, you take an additional 1d4 damage of the same type. This die increases to d6 at 5th level, d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.\r\n\r\n### Pack Tactics\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen you have advantage on an attack roll against a creature, another enemy of the creature is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, you can reroll one of the dice once.\r\n\r\n### Animalistic Momentum\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYou gain a your choice of a climbing or swimming speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you gain an effect while raging based on your choice of speed:\r\n- If you chose a climbing speed, you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.\r\n- If you chose a swimming speed, you can use your bonus action to Dash or Disengage while in water.\r\n\r\n### Lick Wounds\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 10th level_\r\nWhenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points while raging, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your berserker level, which last for the duration of your rage.\r\n\r\n### Hunter's Call\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 14th and 17th level_\r\nWhen you enter your rage, you can choose up to 5 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature. For the duration of your rage, once on each of their turns, an affected ally can add your rage damage bonus to a weapon attack's damage roll.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n## Beastmaster Approach (Companion)\r\n\r\nMany berserkers feel a primal attunement to nature. For berserkers of the Beastmaster Approach, that attunement manifests itself in a bond with a beast companion that accompanies a berserker on his journey.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in Animal Handling.\r\n\r\n### Beast Companion\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to capitalize on a primal attunement to nature to forge a powerful bond with your own beast companion.\r\n\r\nCreate your beast companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. \r\n\r\nIn addition to its traits and features, your beast companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:\r\n- Your beast gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each beast trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your number of available Hit Dice that can be spend to restore hit points is reduced by 1.\r\n\r\nLastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, your beast companion gains the benefits of one of your chosen instincts. If that instinct relies on raging, your beast companion gains the benefits of that instinct while you are raging.\r\n\r\nAt 11th level, your companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet.\r\n\r\n### Pack Tactics\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen you have advantage on an attack roll against a creature your companion has dealt damage since the start of your last turn, you can reroll one of the dice once. When your companion has advantage on an attack roll against a creature you've dealt damage since the start of your last turn, it can reroll one of the dice once.\r\n\r\n### Animalistic Momentum\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 6th, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYour bond with your beast companion strengthens, granting the following benefits while your beast companion is within 10 feet of you:\r\n- If you or your beast have a climbing or swimming speed and the other doesn't, the other gains it with the same speed. If you both have the a climbing or swimming speed, you both use the larger speed of the two, which then increases by 5 feet.\r\n- Whenever your beast deals damage to a hostile creature you can see on your turn, it counts as you taking a hostile action for the purposes of maintaining your rage.\r\n\r\nThis radius increases to 30 feet at 11th level 60 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Lick Wounds\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 10th level_\r\nWhenever your companion reduces a creature to 0 hit points while you are raging, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your berserker level, which last for the duration of your rage.\r\n\r\n### Hunter's Call\r\n_**Beastmaster Approach:** 14th and 17th level_\r\nWhen you enter your rage, you can choose up to 5 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature. For the duration of your rage, once on each of their turns, an affected ally can add your rage damage bonus to a weapon attack's damage roll.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n## Bloodstorm Approach\r\nThe Bloodstorm Approach is said to have originated from the ancient wookiee Hroufrasnooohn clan (which loosely translates to Bloodstorm in Galactic Basic), whose warriors performed gravity-defying feats with their flying vibroaxes through a combination of unorthodox techniques and a mystical belief in their own abilities. A berserker who follows this approach can hurl their devastating weapons at enemies with such power and skill that it completely blurs the line between melee and ranged combat.\r\n\r\n### Furious Throw\r\n_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYour throwing techniques have become a perfect extension of your melee prowess. When you throw a weapon with which you are proficient, you can benefit from your class features that only apply to melee weapon attacks, such as Rage or Reckless Attack.\r\n\r\n### Returning Attacks\r\n_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nAny weapon you throw can ricochet back to you at your command. When you make a thrown weapon attack, you may have the weapon fly back to your hand immediately after the attack.\r\n\r\n### Throw Anything\r\n_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYour strength and mastery of throwing techniques has allowed you to throw vibroaxes as easily as others hurl vibrodaggers. When you are wielding a light- or vibro-weapon with which you are proficient, it gains the thrown property (range 20/60).\r\n\r\n### Fling People\r\n_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 10th level_\r\nYou learn to throw creatures as easily as you throw your weapons. When you successfully grapple a creature, you may immediately throw the creature.\r\n\r\n#### Throw Friend\r\nIf the creature is a willing ally and volunteers to be grappled, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 60 feet. That creature may immediately use its reaction to make one melee weapon attack, adding your Strength modifier to the attack's damage roll.\r\n\r\n#### Throw Foe\r\nIf the creature is an opponent, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 30 feet, where it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier and falls prone.\r\n\r\n### Raging Whirlwind\r\n_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 14th level_\r\nYou can send your weapon spinning into a gravity-defying whirlwind of pain. Once per rage as an action, you may throw a weapon with the thrown property to a point you choose within 60 feet. The weapon fills the air as a cyclone in a 10 foot radius sphere centered on that point. A creature takes damage equal to the thrown weapon's damage + your Strength modifier + your Rage Damage when it enter's the whirlwind's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. This effect ends when you command the weapon to return to you (no action required) or your rage ends.\r\n\r\n## Brawling Approach\r\nMost berserkers require weapons. For berserkers of the Brawling Approach, however, everything is their weapon.\r\n\r\n### Fists of Fury\r\n_**Brawling Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've learned to hone your rage through your fists. Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).\r\n\r\n### Reckless Strikes\r\n_**Brawling Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nWhile you are raging, not wearing heavy armor, and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to forgo your rage damage to make the attack a reckless strike.\r\n\r\nSome of your reckless strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the reckless strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Reckless Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n&emsp;You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Bracing Strike\r\nYou gain temporary hit points equal to your rage damage bonus. If the target is grappled by you, you instead gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rage damage bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Punishing Strike\r\nYour target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Staggering Strike\r\nYour target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability score to use). On a failed save, your target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead knocked prone.\r\n\r\n### Shattering Strikes\r\n_**Brawling Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYour rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials. While raging, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.\r\n- Your unarmed strikes deal double damage against structures.\r\n\r\n### Stop Hitting Each Other\r\n_**Brawling Approach:** 10th level_\r\nYou can grapple creatures two sizes larger than you, instead of one. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can use creatures you have grappled that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so, when you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.\r\n\r\n### Enforcer\r\n_**Brawling Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, your critical hit range increases by 1 for that attack, and on a hit, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling.\r\n\r\n## Champion Approach\r\n\r\nSome berserkers revel in battle for battle's sake. For berserkers of the Champion Approach, this revelry is the goal to which they constantly strive.\r\n\r\n### Champion Superiority\r\n_**Champion Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. See chapter 13 for the maneuvers list.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuvers Known\r\nYou learn two maneuvers of your choice, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the Champion Superiority table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.\r\n\r\nEach time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.\r\n\r\n#### Superiority Dice\r\nYou have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Quantity column of the Champion Superiority table. This die changes as you gain berserker levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Size column of the Champion Superiority table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. \r\n\r\nYou regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuver Ability\r\nYour maneuver ability varies based on the type of the maneuver you use. You use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers. You use this ability whenever a maneuver refers to your maneuver ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a maneuver you use.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your maneuver ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Reckless Maneuvers\r\n_**Champion Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen you use your Reckless Attack feature, you have advantage on superiority die rolls that would be added to the attack or damage rolls of your affected attacks.\r\n\r\n##### Champion Superiority\r\n|Level|Maneuvers Known|Superiority Dice Quantity|Superiority Dice Size|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\r\n| 3rd| 2|2| d4|\r\n| 4th| 2|2| d4|\r\n| 5th| 4|3| d6|\r\n| 6th| 4|3| d6|\r\n| 7th| 5|3| d6|\r\n| 8th| 5|3| d6|\r\n| 9th| 6|4| d8|\r\n|10th| 6|4| d8|\r\n|11th| 7|4| d8|\r\n|12th| 7|4| d8|\r\n|13th| 9|5|d10|\r\n|14th| 9|5|d10|\r\n|15th|10|5|d10|\r\n|16th|10|5|d10|\r\n|17th|11|6|d12|\r\n|18th|11|6|d12|\r\n|19th|12|6|d12|\r\n|20th|12|6|d12|\r\n\r\n### The Thrill\r\n_**Champion Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYou have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being charmed or frightened, and creatures can't have advantage on ability checks or saving throws to avoid being charmed or frightened by effects that you control.\r\n\r\n### Battlefield Euphoria\r\n_**Champion Approach:** 10th level_\r\nWhile raging, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, and when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack, you recover an expended superiority die.\r\n\r\n### Furious Influence\r\n_**Champion Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- You are resistant to psychic damage.\r\n- When you affect an ally with a maneuver, they gain the benefit of one of your damage resistances until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n## Frenzied Approach\r\nFor some berserkers, rage is a means to an end\ufffdthat end being violence. The Frenzied Approach is that of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.\r\n\r\n### Frenzy\r\n_**Frenzied Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can go into a frenzy when you enter your rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one.\r\n\r\nThe first time you use this feature, you suffer no ill effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you suffer one level of exhaustion when your rage ends each time you use it.\r\n\r\nWhen you finish a long rest, you reduce your exhaustion level by 2, instead of 1. Additionally, any effect that removes exhaustion reduces your exhaustion by 1 additional level.\r\n\r\n### Maniacal Rage\r\n_**Frenzied Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nWhile raging, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.\r\n\r\n### Mindless Rage\r\n_**Frenzied Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYou can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.\r\n\r\n### Intimidating Presence\r\n_**Frenzied Approach:** 10th level_\r\nYou can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. While raging, you add double your proficiency bonus to the save DC, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n### Retaliation\r\n_**Frenzied Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.\r\n\r\n## Industrial Approach\r\nWhile some berserkers are content to surrender to their rage, others prefer a more tactful approach. Berserkers of the Industrial Approach augment their rage with the versatility of technology, adding elemental explosions to their already fearsome arsenal.\r\n\r\n### Techcasting\r\n_**Industrial Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Powers Known\r\nYou learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Points\r\nYou have a number of tech points equal to half of your berserker level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;table.\r\n\r\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You may only cast tech powers at &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4th-level once. You regain the &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Techcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Focus\r\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) as a tech focus for your tech powers.\r\n\r\n### Industrious Tech\r\n_**Industrial Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can cast tech powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action and the power does not require concentration. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from tech powers you cast that require a tech attack or saving throw. If a tech power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. \r\n\r\nCasting tech powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a tech power that requires a tech attack.\r\n\r\n### Explosive Resilience\r\n_**Industrial Approach:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nOnce per round, when you deal damage that includes your rage damage, you can cause a localized explosion around the recipient of that damage. Each creature within 5 feet of the damaged creature other than you takes acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) equal to your rage damage bonus, and you gain resistance to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Painkiller\r\n_**Industrial Approach:** 10th level_\r\nWhenever you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, or deal damage using your Explosive Resilience feature, you can cause a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet to gain temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level + your Intelligence modifier. Additionally, while they have these temporary hit points, they have advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause them to be frightened.\r\n\r\n### Final Countdown\r\n_**Industrial Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, and you have at least one tech point remaining, you can expend all your remaining tech points and instead to drop to one hit point (no action required). If you do so, each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, they take 1d12 acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) damage for each tech point spent in this way, or half as much on a successful one.\r\n\r\n##### Industrial Techcasting\r\n| Level | Tech Powers Known | Tech Points | Max Power Level |\r\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\r\n|  3rd |  3 |  2 | 1st |\r\n|  4th |  4 |  2 | 1st |\r\n|  5th |  5 |  3 | 1st |\r\n|  6th |  6 |  3 | 1st |\r\n|  7th |  7 |  4 | 2nd |\r\n|  8th |  8 |  4 | 2nd |\r\n|  9th |  9 |  5 | 2nd |\r\n| 10th | 10 |  5 | 2nd |\r\n| 11th | 11 |  6 | 2nd |\r\n| 12th | 12 |  6 | 2nd |\r\n| 13th | 13 |  7 | 3rd |\r\n| 14th | 14 |  7 | 3rd |\r\n| 15th | 15 |  8 | 3rd |\r\n| 16th | 16 |  8 | 3rd |\r\n| 17th | 17 |  9 | 4th |\r\n| 18th | 18 |  9 | 4th |\r\n| 19th | 19 | 10 | 4th |\r\n| 20th | 20 | 10 | 4th |\r\n\r\n## Precision Approach\r\nSome berserkers have learned to channel their rage into a method of increasing their focus and precision to supernatural levels. Those berserkers who choose the Precision Approach hone their rage to a fine point, becoming agile warriors who ruthlessly dispatch their foes.\r\n\r\n### Careful Steps\r\n_**Precision Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain skills that represent your precise movement. You gain proficiency in your choice of Acrobatics or Stealth. While raging, you have advantage on checks you make with the chosen skill.\r\n\r\n### Focused Rage\r\n_**Precision Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou hone your rage to a razor sharp focus. While raging, when you make a melee weapon attack using Dexterity, you add your rage damage to the damage roll. Additionally, you can use your Reckless Attack feature to give you advantage on melee weapon attacks using Dexterity during your turn.\r\n\r\n### Battle Anticipation\r\n_**Precision Approach:** 6th level_\r\nWhile raging, your critical hit range with melee weapon attacks using Dexterity increases by 1.\r\n\r\n### Improved Danger Sense\r\n_**Precision Approach:** 10th level_\r\nWhile raging, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers, you are treated as proficient in the save, and you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\r\n\r\n### Calm Within the Storm\r\n_**Precision Approach:** 14th level_\r\nThe precision with which you act during your rage causes you to become a storm of reactive lethality. When you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can make a number of opportunity attacks equal to your proficiency bonus without using your reaction, and when a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack using Dexterity against that creature. \r\n\r\n## Warchief Approach\r\nFor some berserkers, it is their duty or birthright to lead their tribe and kin to battle and victory. The Warchief Approach is one forged from alliances, bonds, and strategy. In combat, your rages are less mindless, and more focused. Ignoring the distractions of unimportant events, your attention hones in on the battlefield and how best to direct and control it. You guide your allies' strikes, and your presence is enough to wash away their fatigue.\r\n\r\n### Savage Diplomat\r\n_**Warchief Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYour path necessitates that you build relationships with others, for the betterment of your tribe or yourself. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Persuasion or Intimidation. You can choose to learn one language in place of the skill proficiency.\r\n\r\n### Commanding Rage\r\n_**Warchief Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou become more aware of your allies, and their intent when fighting at your side. While you are raging, when an ally within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an enemy, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack and add your rage damage bonus to the damage roll, if the attack hits.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Inspiring Presence\r\n_**Warchief Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYour mere presence on the battlefield rallies your allies. When you rage, choose up to 3 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).\r\n\r\n### Raid Planning\r\n_**Warchief Approach:** 10th level_\r\nYou learn to flare up your allies' drive for combat, urging them to follow you into the fray. During a long rest, you tell sagas, sing battle songs, and give inspiring speeches. At the end of the long rest choose up to 5 creatures that can hear and understand you (which can include yourself) to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to their next Initiative check, and a 10 foot bonus to their speed on their first turn of combat.\r\n\r\n### War Chant\r\n_**Warchief Approach:** 14th level_\r\nYou have memorized the litanies, songs, and chants of your people and their dedication to war. When you enter a rage on your turn, you can enter a commanding rage for one minute. When you do so, during this turn and at the start of each of your turns, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus you can only use for your Commanding Rage feature. When you use Commanding Rage with these special reactions, they do not count against your uses of that feature. You can only use one reaction per turn. Additionally, during this rage, when an enemy within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an ally, you can use your reaction to reduce the attack by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n## Way of Confluence\r\nThe Force binds us, creating an intangible bridge connecting all living things. Those consulars who follow the Way of Confluence master this power, manipulating those connections to both sustain and torment.\r\n \r\n### Manipulate Life Force\r\n_**Way of Confluence:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a force power, or restore hit points to a creature with 0 hit points with a force power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).\r\n\r\n### Empowered Connection\r\n_**Way of Confluence:** 6th level_\r\nWhile you have temporary hit points, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to any damage or healing you do with force powers that doesn't already include that modifier. \r\n\r\n### Life Eternal\r\n_**Way of Confluence:** 10th level_\r\nYou can use your powerful connection to the Force to keep fighting when others would fall. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can spend 5 force points to drop to 1 hit point instead. \r\n\r\n### Interconnectedness\r\n_**Way of Confluence:** 14th and 17th level_\r\nWhen you cast a 5th level or lower force power that deals damage or restores hit points and targets only one creature, the power can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. \r\n\r\nYou can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Dynamic Attachment\r\n_**Way of Confluence:** 18th level_\r\nWhile you have temporary hit points, you have resistance against the damage of force powers, and your force powers ignore resistances. \r\n\r\n## Way of Endurance\r\nThe Force manifests in myriad ways; while some use the Force to manipulate the world around them, others use it to enhance themselves. Those consulars who follow the Way of Endurance channel the Force to allow them to overcome and reflect the most grievous of injuries.\r\n \r\n### Upheld by the Force\r\n_**Way of Endurance:** 3rd level_\r\nThe Force flowing through your body strengthens you, granting the following benefits:\r\n- Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\r\n- Your base AC becomes 13 + your Constitution modifier. \r\n- When you make a melee weapon attack as a part of a force power you cast, you can use Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as an action, you can gain resistance to kinetic and energy damage for 1 minute. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Retaliation Strike\r\n_**Way of Endurance:** 6th, 9th, &emsp;13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to turn an opponent's aggression back on them. When you deal damage with a force power or a melee weapon attack, if you took damage since the start of your last turn, you deal an extra 1d6 damage. The damage is the same type as the power or weapon's damage.\r\n\r\nThis die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Boundless Vitality\r\n_**Way of Endurance:** 10th level_\r\nWhen you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a force point to regain health equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0. \r\n\r\nThis die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Unrelenting Resilience\r\n_**Way of Endurance:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you use your Boundless Vitality feature while concentrating on a force power, you can add the result of the roll to the Constitution saving throw made to maintain concentration.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright while Upheld by the Force is active, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### The Force Unleashed\r\n_**Way of Endurance:** 18th level_\r\nAs an action, you can choose a point within 60 feet. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and suffers 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and does not suffer exhaustion.\r\n\r\nFor each creature that fails this saving throw, a friendly creature within 30 feet of them can regain hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. A friendly creature can only gain this benefit once per turn.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature six times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n## Way of Manipulation\r\nThe power of the Force is both vast and diverse, with uses varying drastically based on their wielder. Those consulars who follow the Way of Manipulation learn to control their weapons with the Force, maneuvering them across the battlefield.\r\n\r\n### Saber Storm\r\n_**Way of Manipulation:** 3rd, 5th, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to deftly control your weapons utilizing the Force. As an action, you can initiate your Saber Storm. When you do so, select a light- or vibro-weapon within 5 feet that is not worn or carried by a conscious creature other than you, and use the Force to cause it to levitate, acting as an extension of your will for 1 minute. When you activate this feature, you can cause the weapon to move up to 10 feet and make a melee force attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier damage. The type is of the normal damage dealt by the weapon. The weapon then returns to your side.\r\n\r\nYour weapon moves with you, and while Saber Storm is active and you have a weapon animated, on each of your turns you can use an action to move a weapon up to 10 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon then returns to your side. Your Saber Storm ends early if you are incapacitated. At any time, you can end this feature and return the animated weapon to your hand.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while your Saber Storm is active, and at least one animated weapon is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n- You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a power. The bonus equals your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).\r\n\r\nThis feature can animate more than one weapon when you reach higher levels: two weapons at 5th level, three weapons at 11th level, and four weapons at 17th level. When you use your action to attack with your weapons, you can direct them at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each weapon.\r\n\r\nAt 5th level, the distance your weapon can travel increases to 20 feet. This distance increases to 30 feet at 11th level, and 40 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Deceptive Strike\r\n_**Way of Manipulation:** 6th level_\r\nWhen you cast a force power with a range of touch while Saber Storm is active, your animated weapon can move up to its range and deliver the power as if it had cast it. \r\n\r\n### Guarding Weapon\r\n_**Way of Manipulation:** 10th level_\r\nYou can direct your animated weapons to absorb damage while your Saber Storm is activate. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend a number of force points up to your proficiency bonus to have your animated weapon intercept it, and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the number of points spent.\r\n\r\n### Isolate\r\n_**Way of Manipulation:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you deal damage to a creature while Saber Storm is active, and that creature fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can steal and redirect the power. Until the end of your next turn, either you or the creature who failed the Constitution saving throw gain the effects of the power (your choice).\r\n\r\n### Sapping Storm \r\n_**Way of Manipulation:** 18th level_\r\nWhen you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points while Saber Storm is active, you gain temporary force points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). These temporary force points can not exceed your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice), and when you would spend a force point while you have temporary force points, the temporary force points are spent first. When Saber Storm ends, you lose any remaining temporary force points.\r\n\r\n## Way of Negation\r\nSome force users seek mastery over the fundamentals of energy manipulation, known as tutaminis. Those consulars who follow the Way of Negation harness this power to limit the havoc that other force-wielders might wreak.\r\n\r\n### Force Deflection\r\n_**Way of Negation:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nWhen you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to that saving throw equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Power Surge\r\n_**Way of Negation:** 6th level_\r\nYou learn to simultaneously limit a creature's force powers and store that power within yourself to later strengthen your damaging force powers.\r\n\r\nYou can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Whenever you successfully end a force power with a power such as *force suppression* or *sever force*, or use your Force Shield or Force Deflection features to successfully avoid an attack or succeed on a saving throw, you gain one power surge, as you redirect the flow of the Force into yourself. \r\n\r\n&emsp;Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with a force power, you can spend one power surge to deal extra damage to that target. The extra damage is of the same type as the power's damage, and it equals half your consular level.\r\n\r\nWhenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.\r\n\r\n### Enduring Focus\r\n_**Way of Negation:** 10th level_\r\nYou can casually deflect attacks while channeling your power. While you are concentrating on a Force power, you have a +2 bonus to your AC and all saving throws.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can extend your Force Deflection to a creature within 5 feet of you when they fail a saving throw.\r\n\r\n### Conflux\r\n_**Way of Negation:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you use your Force Deflection feature, you can cause a ripple in the Force to expand from you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal to half your consular level.\r\n\r\n### Tutaminis Mastery\r\n_**Way of Negation:** 18th level_\r\nWhen you use a Force-Empowered Casting option, you can spend a power surge to use it without spending additional force points. \r\n\r\n## Way of the Seer\r\nThe Force guides us in innumerable ways, often manifesting as visions. Those consulars who follow the Way of Seer attempt to harness these visions in an attempt to work towards the best possible future, as they see it.\r\n\r\n### Force Visions\r\n_**Way of the Seer:** 3rd level_\r\nGlimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.\r\n\r\n### Powerful Mind\r\n_**Way of the Seer:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou can use your force abilities to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.\r\n\r\nAs an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the *coerce mind* force power at its base level on the creature without expending force points. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the power. \r\n\r\nYou can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Visions of the Past\r\n_**Way of the Seer:** 10th level_\r\nYou can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a force power. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Object Reading.*** Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.\r\n\r\n***Area Reading.*** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.\r\n\r\n### Shielded Thoughts\r\n_**Way of the Seer:** 14th level_\r\nYour thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do. \r\n\r\n### Clarity of Vision\r\n_**Way of the Seer:** 18th level_\r\nThe visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You roll three d20s for your Force Visions feature, rather than two. \r\n\r\n## Way of Technology\r\nWhile many Forcewielders eschew the use of technology, other choose to embrace it. Those consulars who follow the Way of Technology pair their mastery of the Force with the versatility of technology, applying the knowledge in tandem to perform unseen feats.\r\n \r\n### Fundamentals of Mechu-deru\r\n_**Way of Technology:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou've dabbled in adapting your use of the Force, melding it with technology. You gain proficiency in the Technology skill, as well as simple blasters. When you cast a force power that calls for a melee weapon attack, and you are wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you can instead make a ranged weapon attack.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you've learned to manipulate the Force to be able to manipulate technology when it couldn't previously. When you cast a force power that could not affect droids or constructs, you can choose to have it affect droids or constructs. If it would affect multiple targets, you must expend additional uses of this feature for each additional target. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Techcasting Secrets\r\n_**Way of Technology:** 6th, 7th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou've learned to mimic technological effects.

Over the course of a long rest, you create a portable structure that travels with you. \r\n\r\nYour portable structure can only be directed by you, and you must have a tech focus in order to direct it remotely. If you lack a tech focus, you can instead direct it while it is within 5 feet of you. Your portable structure has the following features:\r\n- Its AC equals your tech save DC.\r\n- It has a number of hit points equal to 5 x your engineer level. If your structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses and can't be used again until you spend 1 hour repairing it, which can be done during a short or long rest.\r\n- You can restore missing hit points to your structure by casting the *mending* tech power on it, or by completing a short or long rest. Casting the *mending* tech power restores a number of missing hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), but it can't be repaired to more than half its hit point maximum in this way. Completing a short rest restores your structure to half its hit point maximum, and completing a long rest restores it to its hit point maximum.\r\n- Your structure has two modes: dismantled and deployed. While dismantled, your structure's speed equals your own, it hovers 5 feet off the ground, takes up the space of a 5-foot cube, and weighs 500 lbs. This increases to a 10-foot cube and 1,000 lbs. at 11th level, and a 15-foot cube and 2,000 lbs. at 17th level as you upgrade it. While deployed, your structure's speed is 0 and it takes up space dictated by how its deployed.\r\n\r\nAs an action, you can remotely deploy your structure at a space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, provided there is sufficient space to support it. This range increases to 60 feet at 11th level and 120 feet at 17th level. Automatic dismantling of your structure takes 1 minute, and can be initiated on your turn (no action required).\r\n\r\nYou can deploy your choice from these structures a combined total of four times, and you gain more uses at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you use this feature in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Bridge\r\nYou deploy a bridge up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. The bridge starts from the point at which you deploy it, and extends in a direction of your choice. When you dismantle your bridge, it retracts to the point at which you initially deployed it. Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some fashion; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls. \r\n\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs.

Otherwise, the space within the cube is in complete darkness. The cage is permeable, allowing air, water, and sound to pass through it. You can attempt to trap unwilling Medium or smaller creatures inside the cage. When you deploy this structure in an unwilling creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, it can immediately move to nearest unoccupied space outside of the cage. Otherwise, it is trapped within the structure when it is deployed. \r\n\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the cage can extend up to 15 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Large size or smaller. When you reach 17th level, the cage can extend up to 20 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Huge size or smaller. \r\n\r\n#### Shelter\r\nYou erect a shelter up to 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall, with one-foot-thick walls, a roof, and a floor.

Any creature inside the shelter is protected from hazardous environmental effects outside the shelter such as extreme heat or cold. The structure does not provide additional breathing air for anyone inside if the environment it is placed in is not breathable. The shelter can comfortably support up to 5 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures.\r\n\r\n&emsp;When you reach 11th level, the shelter can extend up to 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, 15 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, they regain all spent Hit Dice, instead of only half.

For each Large creature, it can instead support 2 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, their exhaustion level is reduced by 2, instead of only 1.\r\n\r\n#### Tower\r\nYou erect a tower from a 5-foot square platform centered on the target location that rises up to 30 feet. If the tower is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the tower. A creature can choose to fail the save. The tower comes equipped with a ladder that reaches from the ground to the platform. \r\n\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the tower's platform can extend 5 feet by 10 feet and rise up to 40 feet. When you reach 17th level, the tower's platform can cover a 10-foot square, and rise up to 50 feet.

The wall includes a ladder on the side of your choice. You choose whether the wall contains any openings otherwise. Any openings chosen in this way can be seen through on both sides. The wall can be climbed, but requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your tech save DC for any creature without a climbing speed. A creature can only make this check once per turn. \r\n\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the wall can deploy up to 45 feet long and 15 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 15 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides half cover to any creature on its ramparts. When you reach 17th level, the wall can deploy up to 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides three-quarters cover to any creature on its ramparts.\r\n\r\n### Potent Fortifications\r\n_**Construction Engineering:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen a friendly creature other than you that you can see is hit with a ranged attack while within 5 feet of your deployed portable structure, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to have your structure take the damage instead. If your structure would normally have immunity or resistance to this damage, it loses that immunity or resistance for this attack.

They have an explosive for every situation, whether it be breaching a fortified bunker, taking down a walker, or simply demonstrating that in combat, standing too close to your squadmates can be fatal.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Demolitions Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in demolitions kit. Additionally, when you would install a breaching charge, you can do so in half the time.\r\n\r\n### Explosive Charge\r\n_**Demolitions Specialist:** 3rd, 7th, and 15th level_\r\nYou learn to create a number of small explosives known as charges. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create a number of charges equal to your Intelligence modifier. You must have a demolitions kit in order to create these charges. Your charges can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.\r\n\r\nOnce per turn, when you would make a ranged weapon attack, you can instead throw one of your charges. Your charges have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. You can throw a charge at a point you can see within range. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier). A creature takes 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. \r\n\r\nThe damage of your charges increases to 3d4 at 7th level and 4d4 at 15th level.\r\n\r\n### Cause and Effect\r\n_**Demolitions Specialist:** 7th level_\r\nYou learn to throw grenades as a bonus action.

If the target fails its saving throw against the charge, you impose disadvantage on the attack roll made against you.\r\n\r\n### Backup Plans\r\n_**Demolitions Specialist:** 15th level_\r\nWhen you roll initiative and have no charges remaining, you can create 2 charges.

With their deep understanding of both their weapon and how to manipulate its ammunition on the fly, they can often turn the tides of a battle with a single shot.\r\n\r\n### Studied Shooter\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn specialized theory typical for practitioners of the enhancement trade. You gain proficiency in your choice of the Lore or Technology skills. Additionally, you learn your choice of the *encrypted message* or *minor hologram* tech power. Intelligence is your techcasting ability for these powers.  \r\n\r\n### Special Ammunition\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn ammunition enhancements that are fueled by amplified shots to unleash special enhanced effects.\r\n\r\n#### Ammunition Enhancements\r\nYou know two ammunition enhancements of your choice, which are detailed under \"Ammunition Enhancements\" below, and you earn more at higher levels. Many ammunition enhancements boost an attack in some way. Once per turn when you fire a shot from a blaster as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Ammunition Enhancement options to that shot,\r\n\r\nYou gain an additional Ammunition Enhancement option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.\r\n\r\nEach time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.\r\n\r\n#### Amplified Shots\r\nYou have two amplified shots, which you use to activate your ammunition enhancements. An amplified shot is expended when you use it. When you fire an amplified shot, your weapon is treated as enhanced for overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. You decide to use the option when the shot hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You regain all of your amplified shots when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Saving Throws\r\nSome of your ammunition enhancements require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Ammunition save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Ammunition Enhancements\r\nThe ammunition enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Carbonite Shot\r\nWhen this shot strikes its target, shards of carbonite wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 cold damage, it gains 1 slowed level, and it takes 2d6 kinetic damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.\r\n\r\nThe cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Coercing Shot\r\nYou enhance your shot with chemicals that confuse the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.\r\n\r\nThe poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Explosive Shot\r\nYou fire a shot set to explode on impact. The shot detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage each.\r\n\r\nThe fire damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Hallucinogen Shot\r\nYou enhance your shot with hallucinogenic chemicals. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nThe psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Piercing Shot\r\nYou enhance your shot with armor-piercing properties. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.\r\n\r\nThe extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Quell Shot\r\nYou fire a shot enhanced with a debilitating poison. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nThe poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Seeking Shot\r\nYou apply a tracing signal to your shot. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.\r\n\r\nThe kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Shot\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 7th level_\r\nYou gain the ability to enhance your shots. Whenever you fire an unenhanced shot from a blaster, you can make it enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.\r\n\r\n### Redirected Shot\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 10th level_\r\nYou learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with an enhanced shot and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.\r\n\r\n### Ever-Ready Shot\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 15th level_\r\nYour enhanced ammunition is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Special Ammunition remaining, you regain one use of it.\r\n\r\n### Ammunition Upgrades\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 18th level_\r\nYour ammunition enhancements improve.\r\n\r\n## Exhibition Specialist\r\n\r\nThose fighters who choose to become Exhibition Specialists can't help but show off.

Each creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. This effects ends on a target after 1 minute, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.\r\n\r\nThis die increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and 1d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Glory Kill\r\n_**Exhibition Specialist:** 7th level_\r\nAs you defeat your enemies in combat, you can weaken the morale of other foes or bolster the resolve of your allies alike. When you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can choose one or more creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen \r\n\r\ncreatures are affected by one of the following effects of your choice:\r\n- The creature gains temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).\r\n- The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n### Relentless Competitor\r\n_**Exhibition Specialist:** 10th level_\r\nOnce on each of your turns, you can regain a use of your Action Surge (no action required). If you do so, you immediately suffer one level of exhaustion.\r\n\r\n### Glorious Defense\r\n_**Exhibition Specialist:** 15th level_\r\nYour glory on the battlefront can misdirect attacks. When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss you. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this reaction.\r\n\r\n### The Beauty of Violence\r\n_**Exhibition Specialist:** 18th level_\r\nYou've perfected a fighting style that allows you to stylishly dominate the field of battle.

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn.

While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn.

If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you.

Unless the save succeeds, the creature is dazed, suffering from the charmed condition, for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, tearing free on a success.\r\n\r\n#### Totem of the Vornskr\r\nWith this totem you are able to access the Force-enhanced senses of the vornskr, granting you advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you are not incapacitated.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action to enter a state of hyper awareness for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. \r\n\r\n### Totemic Might \r\n_**Totem Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can channel the power of your Force awareness temporarily.

On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak a deliberate lie for 1 minute and all Charisma checks directed at the creature are made with advantage for the duration. \r\n\r\nOn a success or failure, a creature is aware that you attempted to influence them. They can choose to avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie. \r\n\r\n### Preternatural Counter\r\n_**Jal Shey Order:** 6th level_\r\nYour quick mind and study of your foe allows you to use their failure to your advantage. When a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make an unarmed strike against that creature.\r\n\r\n### Mercurial Mind\r\n_**Jal Shey Order:** 11th level_\r\nYou've honed your awareness and reflexes through mental aptitude and pattern recognition. Once per turn, if you've already used your reaction, you can spend 1 focus point to take an additional reaction. You can only take one reaction per turn.\r\n\r\n### Debilitating Barrage\r\n_**Jal Shey Order:** 17th level_\r\nYou've gained the knowledge to temporarily inhibit a creature's fortitude by striking a series of pressure points. Whenever you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 focus points to cause the creature to become vulnerable to a damage type of your choice. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until they take damage of the chosen type.\r\n\r\n## Kage Order\r\nMonks of the Kage Order, known as Kage warriors, have mastered fighting in darkness, using that which others fear as a weapon against them. Kage warriors learn tricks to create darkness where none exists, fighting using their intuition rather than relying on sight.\r\n\r\n### Darkness Charges\r\n_**Kage Order:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to create a number of small charges that create enhanced darkness. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create two charges. You can create an additional charge at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Your charges can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.\r\n\r\nOnce per turn, when you would make a weapon attack or unarmed strike, you can instead throw one of your charges. Your charges have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. You can throw a device at a point you can see within range. The charges create a pocket of darkness in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point. The darkness spreads around corners. It lasts for 1 minute or until an enhanced source of bright light dispells it.\r\n\r\n### Disruptive Shock\r\n_**Kage Order:** 6th level_\r\nOnce per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack when you have advantage, or it fails a saving throw against an effect that you control, you can choose to roll a Martial Arts die and deal additional psychic damage equal to the amount rolled.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### One With Darkness\r\n_**Kage Order:** 11th level_\r\nYou have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a power, otherwise take a hostile action, or are in an area of bright light.\r\n\r\n### Opportunist\r\n_**Kage Order:** 17th level_\r\nYou can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.\r\n\r\n## Kyuzo Order\r\nMonks of the Kyuzo Order turn weapon throwing into a true art form. Inspired by the skill of native kyuzo wielding their war helmets as both shield and weapon, these monks utilize any thrown object they can find to defend themselves and others while they attack enemies from angles both surprising and devastating.\r\n\r\n### Intercept\r\n_**Kyuzo Order:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in vibroweapons with the thrown property and they become monk weapons for you. Additionally, when you throw an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient in it, and it uses your Martial Arts die instead of its 1d4. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you've learned to use thrown weapons to intercept projectiles traveling towards your allies. When you are wielding a weapon with which you are proficient, and a creature within your weapon's normal thrown range is hit by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to throw your weapon to intercept the projectile. When you do so, the damage the creature takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If the weapon has the returning property, it then returns to your hand.\r\n\r\n### Scattering Stance\r\n_**Kyuzo Order:** 6th level_\r\nWhen you take the Dodge action, until the start of your next turn you gain a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus that you can only use for your Intercept feature. You can only take one reaction per turn.\r\n\r\n### Curved Throw\r\n_**Kyuzo Order:** 11th level_\r\nYou can curve your throws behind cover. When you make an attack roll with a weapon with the thrown property, you can spend 1 focus point to cause the target to gain no benefit from shields or cover, unless that cover is full cover.\r\n\r\n### Relentless Assault\r\n_**Kyuzo Order:** 17th level_\r\nWhen you make multiple weapon attacks with thrown weapons against the same target on your turn, each attack after the first gains a +1 bonus to its attack roll, cumulatively, to a maximum bonus of +6.\r\n\r\n## Kro Var Order\r\nMonks of the Kro Var Order\ufffdknown as shapers\ufffdutilize a unique power to bend the four elements to their will, creating effects as small as a floating flame to quakes that sunder the earth.\r\n\r\n### Elemental Attunement\r\n_**Kro Var Order:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou gain the ability to bend the elements to your will. As an action, you can manipulate these forces to create one of the following effects of your choice at a space within 10 feet of you:\r\n- Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.\r\n- Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.\r\n- Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.\r\n- Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.\r\n\r\nThis range increases to 30 feet at 11th level and 60 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 1 focus point to conjure a weapon made of one of the four elements\ufffdair, earth, fire, or water\ufffdwhich lasts for 1 minute. Your weapon takes an appearance of your choice, it can only be used by you, and you can't be disarmed of it while you are conscious. You are proficient in this weapon, which counts as a monk weapon for you and uses your Martial Arts die for its damage rolls. You can only have one of these weapons at a time, and if you summon a new one the old one immediately disappears.\r\n\r\n#### Air\r\nYour whistling weapon has the returning property, the thrown property with a range of 20/60, and deals sonic damage on a hit. Additionally, when you hit a creature with the weapon, it is deafened until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Earth\r\nYour earthen weapon takes the form of stone, and deals kinetic damage on a hit. Additionally, when you hit a creature with it, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet. Lastly, while active, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity when determining your AC, as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Fire\r\nYour flaming weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, deals fire damage, and when you hit a creature with it, the creature takes additional damage equal to half your focus ability modifier (minimum of one).\r\n\r\n#### Water\r\nYour watery weapon has the reach property, deals cold damage on a hit, and you can use your focus ability modifier instead of Dexterity or Strength for its attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack, you can instead use your weapon to wet a 5-foot square within your weapon's reach. The affected area is difficult terrain. Each creature who starts its turn in the square or enters it for the first time must make a Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.\r\n\r\n### Elemental Adept\r\n_**Kro Var Order:** 6th, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou gain two of the following features. You gain an additional option at 11th and 17th level. \r\n\r\nYou can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 2 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 2 until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Burning Ember Flourish\r\nYou can use your action to choose an area of flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within 60 feet. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.\r\n\r\n***Fireworks.*** The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n***Smoke.*** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.\r\n\r\n#### Curtain of Unyielding Wind\r\nAs an action, you call up a mighty gale, which swirls around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for 10 minutes. The wind deafens both you and other creatures in its area. It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller and hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you and the attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.\r\n\r\n#### Crushing Hand of the Mountain\r\nAs an action, you can choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 kinetic damage and is restrained for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your focus save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.\r\n\r\n#### Hatchling's Flame\r\nAs an action, you focus your energy into a torrent of fire that streaks away from you. A line of roaring flame \r\n\r\n30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\n#### Patient Bantha Listens\r\nYou reach out to the ground beneath you. You can use your bonus action to gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet and a burrow speed equal to your walking speed for up to 1 minute. Your movement leaves behind a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active, after which it collapses.\r\n\r\n#### Rush of the Shyrack\r\nAs an action, you form a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that blasts from you in a direction you choose for one minute or until you lose concentration or dismiss the effect (no action required). Each Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.\r\n\r\n#### Shape the Raincloud\r\nYou can use your action pull water from air, and return it to the atmosphere. In an open container, you can create up to 20 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog.\r\n\r\n#### Swarming Ice Rabbit\r\nAs an action, you can cause a flurry of ice crystals to erupt from a point you can see within 90 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.\r\n\r\n### Elemental Master\r\n_**Kro Var Order:** 11th and 17th level_\r\nAt 11th level, you gain one of the following features. You gain an additional option at 17th level.\r\n\r\nYou can use these features a combined number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 3 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 3 until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Earth Reaches for Sky\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Crushing Hand of the Mountain_ &emsp;or _Patient Bantha Listens_\r\nAs an action, you can choose a point you can see on the ground within 120 feet. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.\r\n\r\n#### Ride the Wind\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Curtain of Unyielding Wind_ &emsp;or _Rush of the Shyrack_\r\nAs an action, you can gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed for 10 minutes. You can hover while this technique is active, but when it ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.\r\n\r\n#### River of Hungry Flame\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Burning Ember Flourish_ &emsp;or _Hatchling's Flame_\r\nAs an action, you can create a wall of fire on a solid surface within 120 feet. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute.\r\n\r\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\r\n\r\nOne side of the wall, chosen by you when you use this feature, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side of the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\r\n\r\n#### Shape the Flowing River\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Shape the Rainclud_ &emsp;or _Swarming Ice Rabbit_\r\nAs an action, you can control any freestanding water within 300 feet of you inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you use this feature. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller creatures struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of being knocked prone. The water level remains elevated until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. \r\n\r\n&emsp;***Part Water.*** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the feature's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\r\n\r\n***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the feature's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the feature ends or you choose a different effect.\r\n\r\n***Whirlpool.*** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your feature save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and is caught in the vortex until the feature ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\r\n\r\n### Elemental Paragon\r\n_**Kro Var Order:** 17th level_\r\nYou gain one of the following features. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used the chosen feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 4 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 4 until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Archetype of Air\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Ride the Wind_\r\nAs an action, you conjure a whirlwind around you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:\r\n- Ranged attacks made against you have disadvantage.\r\n- You gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are still flying when the technique ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.\r\n\r\n- You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.\r\n\r\n#### Figure of Flame\r\n_**Prerequisite:** River of Hungry Flame_\r\nAs an action, you cause flames to race across your body, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:\r\n- You have resistance to fire damage.\r\n- The flames shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.\r\n- Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 1d10 fire damage.\r\n- You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.

The radius moves with you.\r\n- You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing ice extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.\r\n\r\n#### Embodiment of Earth\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Earth Reaches for Sky_\r\nAs an action, you cause rock to envelop you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:\r\n- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.\r\n- You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without spending extra movement.

If you do so, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.\r\n- You can use your action to create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15-foot radius centered on you. Other creatures on that ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.

You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Rakatan Order Techcasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your techcasting ability for your tech powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 focus point to use it.

If you would already have expertise in the check, you instead have advantage on the roll. \r\n\r\n### Spitting Rawl\r\n_**Teras Kasi Order:** 17th level_\r\nYou have learned to harness your strikes in a blistering fury. On your turn, when a creature takes damage from you three times, you can make up to three additional unarmed strikes against the creature (no action required).

You roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your Whills weapon when attacking in this way. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.\r\n- When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a Whills weapon, you can instead reload the weapon.\r\n\r\n### The Force is With You\r\n_**Whills Order:** 6th level_\r\nAs you channel the Force through you, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- You can use your Stunning Strike feature when you hit with a ranged weapon attack while you are wielding a Whills weapon. \r\n- You can spend up to 3 focus points to reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter).

They must end this movement within 30 feet of you.\r\n- **Disengage:** The creature can move up to 5 feet.

That ally immediately gains temporary hit points equal to the amount of rolled.\r\n\r\n#### Reaffirming Strike\r\nYou use the authority your attacks carry to help your ally focus on the task at hand. Choose a creature within 60 feet of you who can see or hear you and that is currently charmed or frightened by the creature you would deal Sneak Attack damage to. The condition immediately ends on that creature.\r\n\r\n#### Bolstering Strike\r\nYou choose a friendly creature within 60 feet of you who can see or hear you. Once before the start of your next turn, if that creature hits the creature against which you forwent two Sneak Attack damage dice, they deal additional damage to the target equal to the maximum of the two Sneak Attack dice.\r\n\r\n### Open Opportunity\r\n_**Bolstering Practice:** 9th level_\r\nOnce per turn, when you take the Attack action and hit a creature without applying your Sneak Attack damage to it, you can forgo your Sneak Attack damage for the turn and use your bonus action to throw the creature off balance. The next ally to hit that creature before the start of your next turn may add your Sneak Attack dice to the damage of their attack. \r\n\r\n### Ambush Tactics\r\n_**Bolstering Practice:** 13th level_\r\nWhen attempting to move stealthily as a group, you may choose a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier.

You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield:\r\n- Your damage die for your unarmed strikes and natural weapons increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8), and you can apply your Sneak Attack damage when you hit with an unarmed strike even if it doesn't have the finesse property.\r\n- You don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.\r\n- You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.\r\n\r\n### Skilled Grappler\r\n_**Disabling Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn a number of grappling techniques to subdue your opponents. When you hit a creature grappled by you with an unarmed strike and deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a grappling technique.\r\n\r\nSome of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Grapple Technique save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Constrict\r\nYou attempt to choke the target into unconsciousness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your following turn.  \r\n\r\nIf you maintain this technique for 1 minute, the target falls unconscious for 1 hour. Droids and constructs can not be knocked unconscious in this way.\r\n\r\n#### Disarm\r\nYou attempt to disarm a weapon or other object the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.\r\n\r\n#### Hip Toss\r\nYou attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw.

Moving a grappled creature the same size as you or smaller no longer halves your speed, and when a creature grappled by you would grant you half cover, you instead have three-quarters cover. Additionally, when you are hit by an attack while grappling a creature, you can use your reaction to force that attack to instead hit the grappled creature.\r\n\r\n### Kiss the Wall\r\n_**Disabling Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou can use your surroundings to further punish the target of your grapple. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Sneak Attack damage die for an unarmed strike you make against a creature grappled by you, you can treat the result of the die as a 3.\r\n\r\n### Neck Snap\r\n_**Disabling Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou learn how to immediately remove your grappled opponent from the fight. As an action, you can force a creature grappled by you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, if the creature has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies.

You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Trick Shooter\r\n_**Gunslinger Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn a number of trick shots you can use to debilitate enemies and impress allies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a trick shot. \r\n\r\nSome of your trick shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Trick Shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Blinding Shot\r\nYou attempt to blind the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. \r\n\r\n#### Brutal Shot\r\nYou attempt to knock the target prone. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  \r\n\r\n#### Hampering Shot\r\nYou attempt to hobble the enemy's movement. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw.

As an action, you can cause one creature within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. \r\n\r\n### Ricochet Shot\r\n_**Gunslinger Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou learn how to work all the angles. Once per turn, when you take the Attack action and miss with a ranged weapon attack, you can repeat the attack against a different target within 10 feet of the original target (no action required).\r\n\r\n### Quickdraw\r\n_**Gunslinger Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou learn to perform miracles with just a blaster and some nerve. On your first turn in combat, if you aren't surprised, you can use your action to attack creatures that have not yet acted. Choose up to six such creatures that you can see, making a ranged weapon attack against each. On a hit, you deal normal weapon damage and can apply a single trick shot to each attack made this way. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n## Maverick Practice\r\n\r\nThere are those who, when thrust into danger, use unexpected methods to achieve victory.

This die changes as you gain operative levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Size column of the Maverick Superiority table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. \r\n\r\nYou regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuver Ability\r\nYour maneuver ability varies based on the type of the maneuver you use. You use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers. You use this ability whenever a maneuver refers to your maneuver ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a maneuver you use.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your maneuver ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Know a Bit\r\n_**Maverick Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can add half your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\n### Outplayed\r\n_**Maverick Practice:** 9th level_\r\nWhen a creature fails a saving throw or ability check against you or an effect you control, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use Sneak Attack, you can't have disadvantage on attack rolls against that creature, and that creature can't have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against effects you control. These effects last until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n##### Maverick Superiority\r\n|Level|Maneuvers Known|Superiority Dice Quantity|Superiority Dice Size|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\r\n| 3rd| 2|2| d4|\r\n| 4th| 2|2| d4|\r\n| 5th| 4|3| d6|\r\n| 6th| 4|3| d6|\r\n| 7th| 5|3| d6|\r\n| 8th| 5|3| d6|\r\n| 9th| 6|4| d8|\r\n|10th| 6|4| d8|\r\n|11th| 7|4| d8|\r\n|12th| 7|4| d8|\r\n|13th| 9|5|d10|\r\n|14th| 9|5|d10|\r\n|15th|10|5|d10|\r\n|16th|10|5|d10|\r\n|17th|11|6|d12|\r\n|18th|11|6|d12|\r\n|19th|12|6|d12|\r\n|20th|12|6|d12|\r\n\r\n### Practice Makes Perfect\r\n_**Maverick Practice:** 13th and 17th level_\r\nWhen you make an ability check as part of or that is affected by a maneuver you use, you can choose to increase your level of proficiency in that check by one step (from trained to proficient, from proficient to expertise, from expertise to mastery, from mastery to high mastery, or from high mastery to grand mastery).\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature five times.

You gain proficiency in the Performance skill and one musical instrument of your choice.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while you are not wearing armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, you can add half your Charisma modifier to your AC as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\n### Dazzling Steps\r\n_**Performance Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to conduct impressive displays of grace and speed in combat. While you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, and you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a weapon with either the light or finesse properties, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a dazzling step.\r\n\r\nSome of your dazzling steps require your target to make a saving throw to resist the dazzling step's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Dazzling Step save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Defensive Step\r\nYou defend yourself from further attack. Roll two Sneak Attack dice. You gain temporary hit points that last until the start of your next turn equal to the amount rolled.\r\n\r\n#### Mobile Step\r\nYou twist and twirl around the target.

On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.\r\n\r\n#### Offensive Step\r\nChoose another creature that you can see within your reach. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, roll two Sneak Attack dice. The creature takes damage equal to the amount rolled. This damage is of the same as your weapon's damage.\r\n\r\n### Flexible Body\r\n_**Performance Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYou are able to use your acrobatic talent to gain the upper hand in combat. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to shove or trip a creature. When you do so, you can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you now ignore difficult terrain, you can move through space occupied by hostile creatures, and you can squeeze through smaller spaces without expending extra movement.\r\n\r\n### Dance of Death\r\n_**Performance Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou can use your action to make a weapon attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. You can choose to deal Sneak Attack damage to each creature you hit, but you can only roll half your number of Sneak Attack dice per creature.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Master of Dance\r\n_**Performance Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYour confidence when putting on a show has extended into combat. You add your Charisma modifier to initiative checks. Additionally, any creature who fails a saving throw against your Dazzling Step save DC has disadvantage on the first attack roll they make against you each turn until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n## Pugnacity Practice\r\nThose operatives who choose the Pugnacity Practice apply an atypical versatility to their actions, comfortably dispatching foes from afar or face to face.\r\n\r\n### Tools of the Trade\r\n_**Pugnacity Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've learned to move swiftly while wielding larger armaments. You gain proficiency with medium armor and martial vibroweapons. If you are already proficient in medium armor, you instead gain proficiency in heavy armor. Additionally, you can deal Sneak Attack damage with any weapon, as long as it does not have the heavy or special properties.\r\n\r\nLastly, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is below its hit point maximum. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.\r\n\r\n### Blitz Attack\r\n_**Pugnacity Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've learned ways to use your martial ability to boost your combat performance. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a blitz attack.\r\n\r\nSome of your blitz attacks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the attack's effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Blitz Attack save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Demoralizing Attack\r\nThe target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Diverting Attack\r\nRoll two of your Sneak Attack dice. The first time the target would deal damage before the start of your next turn, that damage is reduced by an amount equal to the resulting roll.\r\n\r\n#### Warmonger's Attack\r\nIf the target makes an attack against you or an allied creature within 5 feet of you before the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against it.\r\n\r\n### Extra Attack\r\n_**Pugnacity Practice:** 9th level_\r\nWhen you take the Attack action on your turn, you can choose to attack twice, instead of once. Additionally, you can deal Sneak Attack damage any number of times on your turn. Each time you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can choose how many Sneak Attack dice you apply. You can't apply more than your total Sneak Attack dice each turn.\r\n\r\n### Unrelenting Advance\r\n_**Pugnacity Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against effects that would grapple or restrain you. Additionally, if you are grappled or restrained, and you could use your action to attempt to end the effect, you can instead use your bonus action.\r\n\r\n### Razor Focus\r\n_**Pugnacity Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou can enter a hyper-focused state of mind for 1 minute as a bonus action. You must maintain concentration, as if concentrating on a power. For the duration, each time you successfully deal Sneak Attack damage against a creature, you gain two additional Sneak Attack dice, cumulatively, as your attacks become increasingly precise. These additional dice are lost when your focus ends, whether through failing to maintain concentration or after 1 minute.\r\n\r\nThe first time you use this feature, you suffer no ill effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you suffer one level of exhaustion each time you use it.\r\n\r\n## Ruffian Practice\r\nThose operatives who choose the Ruffian Practice use rough-and-tumble tactics to handle any fight, big or small. They incite chaos and make devious moves that keep their enemies reeling.\r\n\r\n### Rakish Audacity\r\n_**Ruffian Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYour unmistakable confidence propels you into battle. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.\r\n\r\nFinally, during your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.\r\n\r\n### Nimble Step\r\n_**Ruffian Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to fluidly strike and maneuver through combat. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to maneuver across the battlefield.\r\n\r\nSome of your fancy footworks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Nimble Step save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Blade Defense\r\nYou attempt to determine your target's next strike. Roll two Sneak Attack dice, and the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your AC increases by the higher amount rolled on the dice against the first attack it makes against you before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, your AC instead increases by the lower amount.\r\n\r\n#### Disarming Strike\r\nYou attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. If you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.\r\n\r\n#### Fancy Footwork\r\nRoll two Sneak Attack dice. Your speed increases by 5 x the greater result of the two dice, and you ignore difficult terrain until the end of your current turn.\r\n\r\n### Panache\r\n_**Ruffian Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYour charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.\r\n\r\n&emsp;If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a power, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.\r\n\r\nIf you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.\r\n\r\n### Elegant Maneuver\r\n_**Ruffian Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.\r\n\r\n### Master Duelist\r\n_**Ruffian Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYour mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you do so, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n## Saboteur Practice\r\nThose operatives who choose the Saboteur Practice enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with tech, using advanced technology with the aid of a tracker droid to sustain a longer assault.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Saboteur Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in astrotech's implements.\r\n\r\n### Techcasting\r\n_**Saboteur Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad.

You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Points\r\nYou have a number of tech points equal to half of your operative level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Saboteur Practice Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Saboteur Practice Techcasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Focus\r\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.\r\n\r\n### Tracker Droid Companion\r\n_**Saboteur Practice:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own tracker droid companion.\r\n\r\nCreate your tracker droid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have astrotech's implements in order to create your droid.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its traits and features, your tracker droid companion gains an additional benefit while it is bonded to you:\r\n- Your tracker droid gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each droid trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of tracker droid traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).\r\n\r\nLastly, when you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that would affect only one target, and your tracker droid companion is bonded and within 10 feet of you or your target, your tracker droid companion can use its reaction to increase the level at which you are casting your power by 1. This feature can increase a power's level above your Max Power Level, and using this feature does not cost additional tech points.\r\n\r\nAt 11th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 30 feet of you or your target to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 60 feet.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

Each creature within 5 feet of your tracker droid must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes ion damage for each Hit Die expended in this way on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. The size of the damage die equals the size of your tracker droid's Hit Die. Any electronics not being worn or carried within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted.\r\n\r\n##### Saboteur Techcasting\r\n| Level | Tech Powers Known | Tech Points | Max Power Level |\r\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\r\n|  3rd |  3 |  2 | 1st |\r\n|  4th |  4 |  2 | 1st |\r\n|  5th |  5 |  3 | 1st |\r\n|  6th |  6 |  3 | 1st |\r\n|  7th |  7 |  4 | 2nd |\r\n|  8th |  8 |  4 | 2nd |\r\n|  9th |  9 |  5 | 2nd |\r\n| 10th | 10 |  5 | 2nd |\r\n| 11th | 11 |  6 | 2nd |\r\n| 12th | 12 |  6 | 2nd |\r\n| 13th | 13 |  7 | 3rd |\r\n| 14th | 14 |  7 | 3rd |\r\n| 15th | 15 |  8 | 3rd |\r\n| 16th | 16 |  8 | 3rd |\r\n| 17th | 17 |  9 | 4th |\r\n| 18th | 18 |  9 | 4th |\r\n| 19th | 19 | 10 | 4th |\r\n| 20th | 20 | 10 | 4th |\r\n\r\n### Sabotage\r\n_**Saboteur Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou gain the ability to sabotage a tech power in the process of being cast. When a hostile creature casts a tech power, and you are the target of the tech power or within its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.\r\n\r\nOn a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and the caster takes 1d6 lightning damage per level of the power it was casting. Additionally, on a failed save, the caster's tech focus used to cast the tech power is overloaded and can't be used to cast tech powers for 1 minute. \r\n\r\nAt the end of each of the caster's turns, it can repeat the Intelligence saving throw. On a success, it can use the tech focus to cast tech powers again.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n## Sawbones Practice\r\nThose operatives who choose the Sawbones Practice have studied the humanoid body on a more intimate level than other operatives. While others may know where best to stab in order to kill, you also know how to repair the wounds you inflict, as well as how to make them even deeper.

If you or any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.\r\n\r\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Debilitating Strike\r\n_**Sawbones Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to apply your anatomical knowledge in direct combat, in order to hinder your targets. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to hinder the creature, provided they have the appropiate physiology.\r\n\r\nSome of your debilitating strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Debilitating Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Bleeding Wound\r\nYou attempt to create a lingering wound in the target for one minute. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, at the start of each of the target's turns, it takes true damage equal to one Sneak Attack die and repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. \r\n\r\n#### Crippling Pain\r\nYou attempt to cause distracting pain in the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn. \r\n\r\n#### Hampering Shot\r\nYou attempt to hamper the target's movement.

You are able to use a traumakit or administer a medpac as a bonus action, and when you use a traumakit to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains a number of hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n### Dosage Control\r\n_**Sawbones Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYour knowledge of medicine allows you to partition and ration healing supplies very effectively, without impacting its potency. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a rest, you can carefully measure and mark out dosages of a medpac within reach. The medpac can now be used twice before it is consumed.\r\n\r\nAt your DM's discretion, you may be able to use this feature on other pacs, stims, or adrenals, most likely involving an ability check to succeed.\r\n\r\n### Self-Sustain\r\n_**Sawbones Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou have advantage on death saving throws.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you are stabilized, you regain 1 hit point.

Additionally, when a creature fails a saving throw against the burst or rapid property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can apply your Sneak Attack damage to one creature dealt damage in this way as long as that creature didn't have advantage on the save.\r\n\r\nWhen you reach 9th level in this class, when multiple creatures fail a saving throw against the burst property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can divide your Sneak Attack dice amongst the targets as you see fit.\r\n\r\n### Upper Hand\r\n_**Scrapper Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to use underhanded tactics to gain the upper hand. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to perform an upper hand technique.\r\n\r\nSome of your upper hand techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Upper Hand save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Brutal Hit\r\nYou attempt to knock the target prone while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\r\n\r\n#### Low Blow\r\nYou attempt to stun the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Shank Shot\r\nYou attempt to hamper the target while within 15 feet of it.

Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create two doses of poison. You must have a poisoner's kit in order to create these doses. Your doses can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.\r\n\r\nAs an action, you can use one of your doses to coat one vibroweapon, one slug cartridge, or one wrist launcher dart. A creature hit by the coated weapon must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), taking 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier poison damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.\r\n\r\nThe quantity and damage of your doses increases at higher levels, to three and 2d4 at 5th level, four and 3d4 at 9th level, five and 4d4 at 13th level, and six and 5d4 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Dark Arts\r\n_**Shadow Killer Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to combine poison and stealth to perform assassination techniques. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a dark art.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Dark Arts save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Envenomed Art\r\nYou attempt to poison the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Hallucinatory Art\r\nYou attempt to blind the target.

On a failure, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks from the target.\r\n\r\n### Poisoner\r\n_**Shadow Killer Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYou are a master of poisons. Targets of your poisons cannot have advantage on the saving throw made to resist your poison, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal the application of poisons.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you apply poison to a weapon or its ammunition, that poison can affect an additional hit or an additional piece of ammunition, and when you deal Sneak Attack damage with an attack that would include poison damage, you can change your Sneak Attack damage to poison damage.\r\n\r\n### One With the Dark\r\n_**Shadow Killer Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou learn to partially enter the spirit realm. As an action, you can become invisible as an enhanced effect, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.\r\n\r\nOnce you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can expend one of your poison doses from your Venomous feature to use this feature again.

Your Evasion feature now applies to Constitution saving throws as well as Dexterity saving throws.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever you create poison using your Venomous feature, you can change the damage type to acid, cold, fire, lightning or necrotic. When you do so, and you deal Sneak Attack damage with a weapon coated with your poison, you can also change your Sneak Attack damage to the chosen type.\r\n\r\n## Archaeologist Pursuit\r\n\r\nArchaeologists are those who study the remnants of historical civilizations. Those scholars who choose the Archaeologist Pursuit are driven by a desire to uncover the past, forming a connection to the lives of those that came before, and unlocking within themselves a connection not just to history, but to the Force itself.\r\n\r\n### Studious Excavator\r\n_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency with archaeologist kits and in the Lore skill. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.\r\n\r\n### Forcecasting\r\n_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have learned powers from your studies of civilizations that were also once close to the Force.

You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Archaeologist Pursuit Forcecasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast.

Additionally, you deal an additional 1d4 acid, lightning, or poison damage when you hit with them.\r\n\r\n## Occultist Pursuit\r\n\r\nOccultists research the obscure practitioners of mystical arts, from witches to shamans to sorcerers. Those scholars who choose the Occultist Pursuit learn to harness these magics to bewitch and confound their enemies. \r\n\r\n### Theurgic Research\r\n_**Occultist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in the Lore and Nature skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.\r\n\r\n### Curse of Objurgation \r\n_**Occultist Pursuit:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nWhen you target a creature with your Critical Analysis, you can choose one ability. While it can see you, the target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Heightened Hex\r\n_**Occultist Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nWhen you use your Curse of Objurgation feature, each time the cursed creature deals damage to you or an allied creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to twice your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of 2).\r\n\r\n### Voodoo Doll\r\n_**Occultist Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nOver the course of an hour, which can be done during a short rest, you can perform a ritual to construct an effigy of a creature. In order to do so, you must have at least heard of or seen the creature before, and the target must be in the same system as you. At the end of the hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. This saving throw is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it, as shown in the Knowledge Save Modifier and Connection Save Modifier tables below. \r\n\r\n##### Knowledge Save Modifier\r\n|||\r\n|:--|--:|\r\n|Secondhand (you have heard of the target) |+5|\r\n|Firsthand (you have met the target) |+0|\r\n|Familiar (you know the target well) |-5|\r\n\r\n##### Connection Save Modifier\r\n|||\r\n|:--|--:|\r\n|Likeness or picture |-2|\r\n|Curse of Objurgation |-3|\r\n|Possession or garment |-4|\r\n|Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like |-10|\r\n\r\nOn a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this ritual against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the ritual creates a Tiny doll that is linked to the target. The doll remains linked for 24 hours, or for 10 minutes after you first use it. It disintegrates at the end of this duration. For the duration, you can see and hear the target through the doll as if you were within 5 feet of the creature.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as action while the doll is in your possession, you can expend a Hit Die to torment the target, choosing an effect from the following options:\r\n- **Burn:** The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target believes it is burning. While burning in this way, the target has has disadvantage on attack rolls made with Strength or Dexterity. This effect lasts for 1 hour.\r\n- **Pain:** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be wracked with pain for 1 hour. While in pain in this way, the target takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage whenever it takes damage.\r\n- **Stab:** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain 2 slowed levels and fall prone. The slowed levels effect lasts for 1 hour.\r\n\r\nThe target can only be under 1 effect at a time. When you use a new effect, any existing effects end. Placing an effect on a target requires maintaining your concentration, as if concentrating on a power.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Toil and Trouble\r\n_**Occultist Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou perfect your control of your curses, granting them unmatched potency. When the target of your Curse of \r\n\r\nObjurgation fails a saving throw against one of your maneuvers, you can choose to amplify that maneuver by expending a number of Hit Dice of your choice. The target immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage for every Hit Die spent in this way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when a creature attempts to use a power like *remove curse* or other similar abilities to remove a curse you set, they must roll a Wisdom or Charisma check (their choice) against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, their attempt fails, and any force or tech points spent in this way are wasted.\r\n\r\n### Occultist Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your research on the occult. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Arcane Membrane\r\nYou have advantage on Intelligence (Lore) or Intelligence (Nature) checks.\r\n\r\n#### Evil Eye\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou can cast the *bestow curse* and *remove curse* force powers without spending force points. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting modifier for these powers.\r\n\r\nOnce you've cast a power using this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can cast it again.\r\n\r\n#### Exsanguination\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nWhen a creature marked by your Curse of Objurgation is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction and expend a Hit Die to immediately regain a use of your Curse of Objurgation.\r\n\r\n#### Hexes and Superstitions \r\nWhen you roll a 13 on an ability check, you treat it as if you rolled a 20.\r\n\r\n#### Natural Karma\r\nBefore you use a maneuver or power to set a curse on a target you can see, you can make a contested Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, the target is unaware you set the curse on them.\r\n\r\n#### Savage Sortilege\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nYou ignore resistance to psychic damage, and you have resistance to psychic damage.\r\n\r\n#### Supernatural Vigor\r\nAt the end of a long rest, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet (this includes you) to imbue with unnatural power. The creature's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to your scholar level, and it has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion. Both effects end after 8 hours.\r\n\r\n## Slicer Pursuit\r\n\r\nAcross the galaxy one can find numerous pseudonyms and false identities belonging to the hackers and cyber-infiltrators that call the world of electronics home. Those scholars who choose the Slicer Pursuit put their impressive intellectual prowess to work in the field of technology, to ends both benevolent and malicious.\r\n\r\n### Hacker's Disposition\r\n_**Slicer Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency with slicer's kits and in the Technology skill.

You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Focus\r\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) as a tech focus for your tech powers.\r\n\r\n##### Slicer Techcasting\r\n| Level | Tech Powers Known | Tech Points | Max Power Level |\r\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\r\n|  3rd |  3 |  2 | 1st |\r\n|  4th |  4 |  2 | 1st |\r\n|  5th |  5 |  3 | 1st |\r\n|  6th |  6 |  3 | 1st |\r\n|  7th |  7 |  4 | 2nd |\r\n|  8th |  8 |  4 | 2nd |\r\n|  9th |  9 |  5 | 2nd |\r\n| 10th | 10 |  5 | 2nd |\r\n| 11th | 11 |  6 | 2nd |\r\n| 12th | 12 |  6 | 2nd |\r\n| 13th | 13 |  7 | 3rd |\r\n| 14th | 14 |  7 | 3rd |\r\n| 15th | 15 |  8 | 3rd |\r\n| 16th | 16 |  8 | 3rd |\r\n| 17th | 17 |  9 | 4th |\r\n| 18th | 18 |  9 | 4th |\r\n| 19th | 19 | 10 | 4th |\r\n| 20th | 20 | 10 | 4th |\r\n\r\n### Systems Hijack\r\nAlso at 3rd level, when the target of your Critical Analysis is a droid or construct, or wearing or holding a techcasting focus, that creature is a viable target for any tech powers with you cast with a range of touch.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when the target of your Critical Analysis casts a tech power, you can use your reaction to identify the tech power being cast, and at what level.\r\n\r\n### Potent Programming\r\n_**Slicer Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nWhen a creature succeeds on a saving throw against an at-will tech power you cast that deals damage, the creature takes half the power's damage, but suffers no additional effects of the power.\r\n\r\n### Redirect Error\r\n_**Slicer Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nWhen the target of your Critical Analysis feature casts a tech power that affects an area, you can use your reaction to cause that power to instead affect an area in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the caster. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### System Override\r\n_**Slicer Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou know how to quickly activate anti-tech subroutines you have encoded into your wristpad. You can cast the *diminish tech* and *tech override* powers at 3rd level without expending tech points. If the target is the target of your Critical Analysis, you have advantage on the techcasting ability check for these powers.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Slicer Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your understanding of tech casting. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Administrator's Log\r\nIf you spend at least 10 minutes working on a computer or terminal, you can get a full list of users who have accessed the machine within the past 24 hours. Over the course of a long rest, you may then form a facsimile of identification that would allow you to pass yourself off as that person when accessing machines.\r\n\r\n#### Backdoor Egress\r\nWhen you cast a tech power that affects an area and requires a saving throw, and you are inside that power's area, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If you end this movement outside the area affected by the tech power, you do not have to make a saving throw to avoid its effects. \r\n\r\n#### Intelligence Core Override\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nYou can cast the *override interface* tech power at 5th level without spending tech points. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Resource Appropriation\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 11th level_\r\nIf you reduce the target of your Critical Analysis feature to 0 hit points, and it has tech point remaining, you may choose to gain any tech points it had remaining. Your current tech points cannot exceed your tech point maximum.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Skillful Casting\r\nWhen you hit a creature with an at-will tech power that requires an attack roll, you may treat that attack roll as a weapon attack for the purpose of using maneuvers.\r\n\r\n#### Sleeper Program\r\nWhenever you cast a tech power with a casting time of 1 action, you can choose to delay the power's activation up to a minute. When you do so, you cast the power as normal, but holds its energy for the duration of the delay. Holding onto the power's effect requires concentration. If your concentration is broken before the delay ends, the power dissipates without taking effect. You can use your reaction to activate the power at any time.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

Those scholars who choose the Zoologist Pursuit capitalize on their knowledge of animals, developing a strong bond with a companion with whom they gain an advantage on the battlefield.\r\n\r\n### Wilderness Expert\r\n_**Zoologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in Animal Handling, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks.\r\n\r\n### Beast Companion\r\n_**Zoologist Pursuit:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to forge a powerful bond with your own beast companion.\r\n\r\nCreate your beast companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. \r\n\r\nIn addition to its traits and features, your beast companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:\r\n- Your beast gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each beast trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your number of available Hit Dice that can be spend to restore hit points is reduced by 1.\r\n\r\nLastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, your beast companion gains a bonus to ability checks, armor class, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws equal to half your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of +1).\r\n\r\nThis radius increases to 30 feet at 11th level, and 60 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Vicious Hunting\r\n_**Zoologist Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nYour beast companion's strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. Additionally, when your beast makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may expend a superiority die and apply the benefits of a maneuver you know from this class, as if you had taken the action yourself.\r\n\r\n### Bestial Agility\r\n_**Zoologist Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nYour beast's reflexes and agility allow it to move with a burst of speed. When your beast moves on its turn in combat, it can double its speed until the end of the turn. Once its used this feature, it can't use it again until it moves 0 feet on one of its turns.\r\n\r\n### Feral Ferocity\r\n_**Zoologist Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou have learned how to push your beast beyond its limits.

It ends early if your beast is knocked unconscious. You can end your beast's furious state as a bonus action.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Zoologist Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your studies in biology and behaviour of alien lifeforms. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Advantageous Companion\r\nWhen you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check against a creature that can see your beast companion, and your companion is size Medium or larger, you make the check with advantage.\r\n\r\nWhen you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check against a creature that can see your beast companion, and your companion is size Small or Tiny, you make the check with advantage.\r\n\r\n#### Holocam Attachment\r\nYou have learned how to safely attach a holocam on the head of the companion. You learn the *tracker droid interface* tech power, your beast becomes a valid target of this power, and when you cast this power targeting your beast, you do so without spending tech points. You require use of a wristpad for this power.\r\n\r\n#### Neat Tricks\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYour beast gains proficiency in one Strength or Dexterity skill of your choice. If your beast's size is Medium or larger and the chosen skill uses Strength, it has expertise in the chosen skill. If your beast's size is Small or smaller and the chosen skill uses Dexterity, it has expertise in the chosen skill.\r\n\r\n#### One Big Baddie\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Size Medium or larger beast_\r\nYour beast companion gains the following benefits:\r\n- It deals double damage against structures.\r\n- It can take the Guard action as a bonus action, but it can only guard you in this way.\r\n- It can spend a bonus action to spend one of its Hit Dice to recover hit points.\r\n- When it rolls a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points it can regain from the roll equals twice its Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).\r\n\r\n#### Protective Friend\r\nIf a creature makes a melee attack against you or your companion, and your companion is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.\r\n\r\n#### The More the Merrier\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Size Small or smaller beast_\r\nRather than a single beast companion, you instead control multiple beasts that function as a swarm. Your beast companion gains the following benefits:\r\n- Its effective size increases by two categories (from Tiny to Medium or Small to Large).\r\n- Its hit points increase by an amount equal to twice its level + 2.\r\n- It can only be mounted by creatures at least three size categories smaller than it, instead of one.\r\n- It can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and it can move through any opening large enough for a creature two size categories smaller than it.\r\n- While it is above half its hit point maximum, when it takes the Attack action, it can make an additional attack. If the creature has the Extra Attack feature, this attack is in addition to the attack granted by that feature.\r\n\r\n## Artillerist Technique\r\n\r\nSome scouts choose to navigate around defenses, while others choose to go through them. Followers of the Artillerist Technique learn to exert greater control of their tech powers, causing delayed\ufffdand often empowered\ufffdeffects.\r\n\r\n### Modular Munitions\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen you cast a tech power, rather than having it take effect instantly, you can choose to delay the effect to occur on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). When you do so, any creature that leaves the affected area of your tech power is unaffected when the tech power occurs. If the power would only target one creature, and that creature moves from the space it was in when you cast the power, the tech power automatically misses if it would call for an attack roll, as if you had rolled a 1 on the attack, and the creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw against the power if it calls for a saving throw, as if it had rolled a 20 on the save.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you cast a tech power and choose to delay it in this way, and that tech power would deal damage, you can apply one of the following additional empowerment effects:\r\n- **Flashbang**: Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded and deafened until the start of your next turn.\r\n- **Mire:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain one slowed level until the start of your next turn.\r\n- **Psyche:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nIf an empowerment effect calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your tech save DC.\r\n\r\nYou can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 tech point to use it. When you do so, your maximum tech points are reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Artillerist\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd and 11th level_\r\nYou can now use your Ranger's Quarry feature on a 10-foot cube area within 60 feet of you that you can see. You can treat any creatures inside this cube as if they are the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature, and when a creature is hit by a tech attack or fails a saving throw against a tech power you cast that deals damage, you can apply your Ranger's Quarry damage to that creature.\r\n\r\nAt 11th level, you can now use your Ranger's Quarry feature on a 15-foot cube area, instead of a 10-foot cube.\r\n\r\n### Sundered Defenses\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 7th level_\r\nYour precise bombardments make even the most hardened defenses crumble. When you cast a power that calls for a tech attack or a Dexterity saving throw, it reduces partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against creatures affected by it. If an affected creature has one-quarter cover, your power ignores it entirely.\r\n\r\n### Target Masking\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 11th level_\r\nYou are familiar with various turrets and defensive emplacements, and their operation. \r\n\r\nAs a bonus action, you can activate a masking effect to confuse the targeting of constructs for 1 minute. Any construct who targets you with an attack, a harmful power, or a hostile action must first make a Wisdom saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the construct must choose a new target or lose the attack or power. This power doesn't protect you from area effects.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Master of Ordnance\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 15th level_\r\nYou can now expend two uses of your Modular Munitions feature when you cast a tech power to apply two empowerment effects, instead of only one. Additionally, you gain three additional empowerment effects:\r\n- **Confusion:** Each creature damaged by this power must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, on its next turn, a creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.\r\n- **Knockout:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\r\n- **Static:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become shocked until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you would spend 1 tech point to apply an empowerment effect, it no longer reduces your maximum tech points.\r\n\r\n## Artillerist Technique (Companion)\r\n\r\nWhile some scouts choose to foray alone, others like to have support. Followers of the Artillerist Technique master control of militant constructs, laying waste to the battlefield with their expertise\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in artillerist's implements.\r\n\r\n### Turret Companion\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to apply your knowledge to construct and bond with your own portable turret.\r\n\r\nCreate your turret companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have artillerist's implements in order to create your turret.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its traits and features, your turret companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:\r\n- Your turret is a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.\r\n- Your turret gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each turret trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of turret traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up, minimum of one).\r\n- When you would make a weapon attack, you can let your turret make a weapon attack instead.\r\n\r\nLastly, while your turret is bonded, within 10 feet of you, and the target of your *tracker droid interface* tech power, when you cast a tech power with a range of 5 feet or greater, you can cast it as if you were in your turret's space, and the range increases to 10 feet if it isn't greater.\r\n\r\nBoth the range and radius increase to 30 feet at 11th level, and 60 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Artillerist\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nOnce per round, when your turret deals damage to the target of your Ranger's Quarry, you can roll your Ranger's Quarry die and add it to the damage roll.\r\n\r\n### Crisis Management\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 7th level_\r\nWhile you can see your turret, it can add half its proficiency bonus to any saving throws it makes that doesn't already include it.\r\n\r\n### Double Up\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 11th level_\r\nWhen you deal damage to a creature with a weapon or tech power, your turret has advantage on the next attack roll it makes against the creature or it has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against an effect your turret controls before the start of your next turn. When your turret deals damage to a creature, you have advantage on your next attack roll against the creature or it has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against an effect you control before the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n### Battlefront\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 15th level_\r\nWhen you use your Combat Tech feature, both you and your turret can each make one weapon attack as part of the same bonus action.\r\n\r\n## Deadeye Technique\r\n\r\nSome scouts become legends written in blaster burns. Followers of the Deadeye Technique perfect the art of the blaster shot and utilize their incredible focus to make shots that most would deem impossible. When everything depends on one shot, you want a Deadeye pulling the trigger.\r\n\r\nDue to their uncanny focus, Deadeyes can make shots that other marksmen would never dare to attempt. Deadeyes know how to make the most of ranged weapons and can use them to greater effect than other Scouts.\r\n\r\n### Deadeye Superiority\r\n_**Deadeye Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. See chapter 13 for the maneuvers list.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuvers Known\r\nYou learn two maneuvers of your choice, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the Deadeye Superiority table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.\r\n\r\nEach time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.\r\n\r\n#### Superiority Dice\r\nYou have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Quantity column of the Deadeye Superiority table. This die changes as you gain scout levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Size column of the Deadeye Superiority table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. \r\n\r\nYou regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuver Ability\r\nYour maneuver ability varies based on the type of the maneuver you use. You use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers. You use this ability whenever a maneuver refers to your maneuver ability.

The decoy appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The decoy is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion. For the duration, you can cast tech powers as though you were in the decoy's space. Both your decoy and the target of your tech power must be within your line of sight.\r\n\r\nYou can use your bonus action to cause the decoy to move up to 30 feet. As your decoy changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the decoy. If your decoy is ever more than 120 feet away from you, it immediately disappears.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when both you and your decoy are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the decoy, but is not aware it is an illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.\r\n\r\nA creature that uses its action to examine your decoy can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

When you use your bonus action to move a decoy, you can move any number of them with the same bonus action.\r\n\r\n## Inquisitor Technique\r\nAcross history, there have been those who live to hunt those who wield the Force, be they Jedi or Sith.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the force powers you know and replace it with another force power of no higher level than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Inquisitor\r\n_**Inquisitor Technique:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nWhen the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature is within 15 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Whenever the creature casts a force power, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC to maintain concentration. On a failed save, the casting is disrupted, the force power fails, and the force points are wasted.\r\n- Whenever the creature starts its turn while concentrating on a force power, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC to maintain concentration. On a failed save, it loses concentration on the power.\r\n\r\nThe radius of this feature increases to 30 feet at 11th level and 60 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Sense Force\r\n_**Inquisitor Technique:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou can use your action to gain the benefits of the *force sight* force power until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature three times.

While you are wearing light or medium armor, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when determining your AC. \r\n\r\n### Mark of the Meticulous\r\n_**Mastermind Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can use Intelligence instead of Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against the target of your Ranger's Quarry.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, once per round, when you hit the target of your Ranger's Quarry with a tech attack, or it fails a saving throw against a tech power you cast that deals damage, you can deal additional damage equal to your Ranger's Quarry damage die of the same type as the tech power's damage.\r\n\r\n### Adaptive Techie\r\n_**Mastermind Technique:** 7th level_\r\nWhen you complete a long rest, you can choose up to a number of tech powers you know equal to half your Intelligence modifier and replace them with another tech power, as long as that power is not of a higher level than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n### Emergency Planning\r\n_**Mastermind Technique:** 11th level_\r\nYou've learned to formulate and execute a plan. As an action, you can choose up to six creatures (including yourself) that you can see within 60 feet of you. For each creature, choose one of the following: ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Each creature gains an Emergency Planning die, which is a d8.\r\n\r\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, each creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, as determined when you use this feature. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Emergency Planning die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Emergency Planning die is rolled, it is lost.\r\n\r\nA creature can have only one Emergency Planning die at a time.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\nYour Emergency Planning die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Exploit Weakness\r\n_**Mastermind Technique:** 15th level_\r\nYour training has taught you to find and exploit weaknesses in your prey. As a bonus action, you can impose disadvantage on the next saving throw the target of your Ranger's Quarry makes against an effect you control before the end of your next turn. Once you've done so, you must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again.\r\n\r\n## Mechanist Technique\r\n\r\nSome scouts are peerless inventors, skilled at working with droids and other forms of technology. Followers of the Mechanist Technique make up for the weakness of organics with the strength and purity of their creations.\r\n\r\n### Improved Techcasting\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYour command of techcasting improves.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Tech Powers Known\r\nYou know 7 tech powers of your choice, instead of 5, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table.

As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature:\r\n- For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a d3 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll. Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't receive it again until it finishes a short or long rest.\r\n- Roll a d4. The creature regains a number of tech points equal to the result. Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't receive it again until it finishes a long rest.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each droid trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of droid traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).\r\n\r\n&emsp;Lastly, while your tracker droid companion is bonded and within 10 feet of you, you can use your action to learn the location of any droid or construct, tech focus, tech power or enhanced item within 60 feet of you or your tracker droid that isn't behind total cover. When you sense a tech power in this way, you learn what the power is. At 11th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 30 feet of you or your target to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 60 feet. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Mechanist\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 7th level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can cause the target of your Ranger's Quarry to emit an ion pulse, as long as the target is within 60 feet of you.

If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.\r\n\r\nIntelligent droids are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.\r\n\r\n## Predator Technique\r\nSome scouts work in solitude, while others prefer the strength of a group.

When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Predator\r\n_**Predator Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nIf the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature can see you, a number of friendly creatures you choose up to your Intelligence modifier have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide from it.\r\n\r\n### Predator's Resolve\r\n_**Predator Technique:** 7th level_\r\nYou can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\r\n- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.\r\n- At the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one).\r\n- When you use your Hunting Party feature and the target of the attack is your Ranger's Quarry, your ally gains a bonus to damage on the attack equal to your Ranger's Quarry Damage Die.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Prey on the Weak\r\n_**Predator Technique:** 11th level_\r\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, and the creature is below its hit point maximum, the next attack roll made against that creature before the end of your next turn by someone other than you has advantage.\r\n\r\n### On the Hunt\r\n_**Predator Technique:** 15th level_\r\nWhen you use your Predator's Resolve feature, a number of friendly creatures you choose up to your Intelligence modifier that you can see within 30 feet of you also gain the benefits of the feature.\r\n\r\n## Teleportation Technique\r\n&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether through experimentation or discovery of &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an ancient technology, followers of the &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teleportation Technique have learned to create &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brief teleportation portals, allowing them to &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maneuver and attack both quickly and &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unpredictably throughout the battlefield.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in tinker's implements.\r\n\r\n### Personal Teleporter\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th, and 20th level_\r\nYou can use portable teleporters as a bonus action, instead of an action. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, while you are wielding a tech focus, you can use your bonus action to create a pair of linked portals: one portal appears in a space within 5 feet of you, and the other portal appears in an unoccupied space you can see up to 30 feet away. These portals last until the start of your next turn, and they are large enough to accommodate Medium and smaller creatures and objects. Portals take the appearance of an elongated, shimmering mirror, and looking through a portal, a creature can see through the linked portal as if looking through a window. A creature or object who passes through a portal immediately appears in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal. You can use your reaction to end your portals early. If a creature is partially within your portals, it is shunted back to the space it previously occupied and it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your a tech save DC. On a failed save, it takes energy damage equal to your scout level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest. At the beginning of each of your turns while you have a pair of portals active, you can expend a use of this feature to extend the duration of the portals until the start of your next turn (no action required). The distance at which you can create portals increases at higher levels. It increases to 60 feet at 5th level, 90 feet at 9th level, 150 feet at 13th level, 300 feet at 17th level, and 1,000 feet at 20th level.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Teleporter\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nOn your turn, when you deal damage to the target of your Ranger's Quarry, and either you, your weapon, or the source of your damage have passed through your portals on this turn, when you roll below half the maximum on a damage die, you can treat the roll as if you'd rolled half the maximum on the damage die. You can only affect a number of dice up to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) in this way.\r\n\r\n### Residual Warp\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 7th level_\r\nWhen you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place your portal in a place you've visited in the last 10 minutes, provided you can remember it, as opposed to a place you can see. That place must still be within range of your teleporter.\r\n\r\n### Quantum Entanglement\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 11th level_\r\nWhen you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place the portal that you would normally place within 5 feet of you in a place you can see within your Personal Teleporter's range. If that space is occupied by a Huge or smaller creature or a Medium or smaller unsecured object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. An object automatically fails this saving throw, and a creature can choose to fail. On a failed save, a Medium or smaller creature or object falls through the portal, immediately appearing in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal and falling prone. A Large or Huge creature instead falls prone without moving.\r\n\r\n### Reprisal\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 15th level_\r\nWhen you would be affected by a weapon or tech power that requires a Dexterity saving throw or attack roll and would affect only you, you can use your reaction to instantaneously create a pair of portals to redirect that power to another target within 30 feet. If the weapon or power required a melee or ranged attack roll, make a melee or ranged tech attack roll against the new target, as appropriate. If it required a Dexterity saving throw, the new target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n## Triage Technique\r\nWith every conflict comes death and destruction. Followers of the Triage Technique excel at keeping their comrades in the fight with quick thinking and fast-acting medicine.\r\n\r\n### Triage Training\r\n_**Triage Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in the Medicine skill. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you would use your action to make an ability check to stabilize a creature, expend a use of a traumakit, or use a medpac, you can instead use your bonus action.\r\n\r\n### Mark of Triage \r\n_**Triage Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn new ways to use your Ranger's Quarry. \r\n- While a hostile creature is the target of your Ranger's Quarry, you always know any conditions it is suffering from, and you know at roughly what percentage its current hit points is relative to its maximum. Additionally, if the target is within 60 feet of you, when it is forced to make a Constitution saving throw, you can use your reaction to force it to make the roll with disadvantage. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n- While a friendly creature is the target of your Ranger's Quarry, you have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks made to stabilize it. Additionally, if the target is within 60 feet of you, you can use your bonus action and roll your Ranger's Quarry and either restore hit points equal to the amount rolled, or grant temporary hit points equal to the amount rolled. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Double Dose\r\n_**Triage Technique:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYour application of medicine does not interfere with your own ability to recover from injuries. When you restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to another creature with a tech power or class feature, you recover the same amount of hit points or gain the same number of temporary hit points. \r\n\r\nYou can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Infusion\r\n_**Triage Technique:** 11th level_\r\nWhen you target a creature with your Ranger's Quarry, you can grant one of the following additional effects of your choice:\r\n- ***Adrenaline/Tranquilizer.*** The creature's movement speed is doubled until the end of its next turn. Alternatively, it gains a level of slowed until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n- ***Focus/Dizziness.*** The creature has either advantage or disadvantage (your choice) on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next minute.\r\n- ***Toughen/Weaken.*** The creature gains temporary hit points equal to your scout level, which last for 1 minute. Alternatively, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to your scout level and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nYou can use each feature once. You regain any expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Cure-All\r\n_**Triage Technique:** 15th level_\r\nYour healing becomes even more potent. When you restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature as a bonus action using your Mark of Triage feature, you can also end one of the following conditions afflicting it: blinded, deafened, diseased, paralyzed, or poisoned.\r\n\r\n## Path of Aggression\r\n\r\nFrom the murky depths of the dark side comes seething fury. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Aggression charge their weapon with lightning, culminating in a massive discharge that can ravage their opponents.\r\n\r\n### Voltaic Slash\r\n_**Path of Aggression:** 3rd level_\r\nStarting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *lightning charge* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and when you deal lightning damage with the *lightning charge* force power, you deal additional lightning damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) if it doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\n### Thunderous Momentum\r\n_**Path of Aggression:** 3rd level_\r\nYour stride becomes nigh unbreakable. You are immune to the shocked condition, and each slowed level only reduces your speed by 5 feet, unless it would reduce your speed to 0.\r\n\r\n### Entropic Rush\r\n_**Path of Aggression:** 7th level_\r\nYou've learned to move with speed and precision, discharging your lightning in a massive burst. When you move at least half your speed before casting *lightning charge*, you make the attack roll with advantage. Additionally, on a hit, the lightning can leap a second time, to a third creature within range or back to the first creature.\r\n\r\n### Living Current\r\n_**Path of Aggression:** 13th level_\r\nYou've learned to channel the damage done to you to enhance your strikes. The first time you deal damage on your turn, if you took damage since the start of your last turn, you can deal additional lightning damage equal to your Kinetic Combat die + half the amount of damage taken.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Retaliatory Strike\r\n_**Path of Aggression:** 18th level_\r\nWhen a creature hits you with an attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to cast the *lightning charge* force power, targeting them.\r\n\r\n## Path of Communion\r\nThose who master the Force can transcend death, persisting beyond their natural experation. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Communion bond with a Force ghost, developing a symbiotic relationship which alters the way they perceive their surroundings.\r\n\r\n### Mystical Connection\r\n_**Path of Communion:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn the *feedback* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use the Double Strike Force-Empowered Self option when you cast it as your action and the target fails its saving throw. Finally, when you deal psychic damage with the *feedback* force power, you deal additional psychic damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) if it doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\n### Symbiot Spirit\r\n_**Path of Communion:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou attract the attention of the spirit of a Force ghost. Over the course of one hour, you can attune to the spirit, forging a lasting connection. While attuned to a spirit, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Your spirit is always audible and visible to you. Your spirit can choose to make itself audible and visible or inaudible and invisible to other creatures (no action required), but it is always visible to beings with truesight.\r\n- Your spirit can not interact with the corporeal world, but it is also not impeded by unenhanced walls or barriers.\r\n- Your spirit acts independently of you, and it only obeys your commands if it chooses to. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.\r\n- While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\r\n- When you cast a force power with a range of touch, your spirit can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.\r\n\r\nYou can only attune to one spirit at a time. If you attempt to attune to another spirit, you immediately break the bond with your current spirit.\r\n\r\n> #### Generating Your Spirit\r\n> Your spirit might be the ghost of a benevolent Jedi, discovered in the ruins of a Jedi temple, or a powerful Sith spirit lingering in an ancient artifact. It might be the spirit of a Nightsister sorceress, or a paragon of a long-forgotten monastic order. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your spirit.\r\n\r\n&emsp;Additionally, your spirit can briefly interact with the physical world. When you would make a melee attack, your spirit can deliver the attack as if it had made it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the attack. It uses your modifiers for the attack and damage rolls. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Invasive Presence\r\n_**Path of Communion:** 7th level_\r\nYour spirit can invade another creature's being. As an action, your spirit can touch a creature within 5 feet of it, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. \r\n\r\nOn a failed save, your spirit moves into that creatures space, inhabiting its body, for 1 minute. The affected creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes each turn. At the end of each its turns, the creature repeats this save. On a success, it repels the spirit from its body, and it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Ethereal Vision\r\n_**Path of Communion:** 13th level_\r\nYou and your guiding spirit both gain truesight out to 60 feet as long as your spirit is within 100 feet of you.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you use your action to see through your spirit's senses, you are no longer deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, able to comprehend what happens in both perspectives simultaneously.\r\n\r\n### Assuming Direct Control\r\n_**Path of Communion:** 18th level_\r\nWhen a creature fails its saving throw against your Invasive Presence feature, the target becomes charmed by you for as long as Invasive Presence is active.\r\n\r\nWhile the target is charmed, you and your spirit have a telepathic link with it as long as you are within 100 feet of it. You and your spirit can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \"Attack that creature,\" \"Run over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.\r\n\r\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\r\n\r\n## Path of Ethereality\r\nIn the distant reaches of the galaxy obscure knowledge and forgotten secrets of the Force can sometimes be found. While other Force-sensitive may find themselves touched by this secret knowledge of the Force, those sentinels who follow the Path of Ethereality instead find themselves grabbed. Held onto by mysterious aspects of the Force that refuse to let go, these sentinels find themselves able to manipulate the universe around them.\r\n\r\n### Aberrant Resilience\r\n_**Path of Ethereality:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn the *resistance* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, this power no longer requires concentration for you when you target yourself with it.\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Kinesis\r\n_**Path of Ethereality:** 3rd level_\r\nYour connection to the Force allows you to briefly become incorporeal. When you use a Force-Empowered Self option, until the end of your turn, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain. If you end this movement inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take true damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. \r\n\r\n### Out of Touch\r\n_**Path of Ethereality:** 7th level_\r\nAs an action, you can step out of sync with the rest of the universe for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, roll a d20. If you roll 11 or higher, you and everything your are wearing or carrying are completely invisible to all beings, except for those with truesight. On a roll of 10 or lower, you instead appear as an indistinguishably blurred form roughly your normal height and weight, though a being with truesight sees you normally. Regardless of your appearance, for the duration, your speed doubles, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move through creatures and objects willingly though you can not affect them and they can not affect you. You can end this feature early on your turn (no action required). When this effect ends, if you are inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. \r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Event Cascade\r\n_**Path of Ethereality:** 13th level_\r\nYou have advantage on attack rolls you make against creatures if you haven't dealt damage to them or affected them with a force power since the start of your previous turn.\r\n\r\n### Aberrant Self\r\n_**Path of Ethereality:** 18th level_\r\nYou no longer suffer the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, you no longer need food or water, and you no longer need to sleep. Lastly, the first time you take damage on each of your turns, you can roll your Kinetic Combat die and reduce the damage by that amount.\r\n\r\n## Path of Iron \r\n\r\nMany sentinels choose to focus on a discipline that demands physical strength, reflexes, and fortitude. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Iron train their bodies to their physical peak, able to withstand nigh intolerable punishment and bolster their physical combat capabilities. \r\n\r\n### Form Combat Training\r\n_**Path of Iron:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn one lightsaber form, as detailed in the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you gain proficiency in all martial light- and vibro- weapons.\r\n\r\n### Physical Conditioning\r\n_**Path of Iron:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've undergone special training, increasing your physical capabilities. You gain the following benefits: \r\n- You gain proficiency in medium armor. If you are already proficient in medium armor, you then gain proficiency in heavy armor. While you are wearing light or medium armor, you can use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of your Dexterity modifier when determining your AC.\r\n- Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Force-Empowered Self\r\n_**Path of Iron:** 7th level_\r\nThrough intense physical training, you've improved your body's ability to access and channel the force flowing within you. \r\n\r\nWhen you would use a Force-Empowered Self option, you can choose to bolster the option, gaining an additional effect as listed below. You can only bolster a Force-Empowered Self option once per turn. \r\n\r\nYou can use these features a combined three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 force point to use it.\r\n\r\n#### Aegis\r\nWhen you bolster Deflection, when an attack would hit you before the start of your next turn, you subtract the same value rolled for Deflection from the damage taken.\r\n\r\n#### Cleave\r\nWhen you bolster Double Strike, you choose another creature within 5 feet of your target. They take damage of the same type equal to the result of the die rolled for Double Strike.\r\n\r\n#### Momentum\r\nWhen you bolster Slow Time, until the end of your turn you ignore difficult terrain, and can move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling during the move.\r\n\r\n### Follow Through\r\n_**Path of Iron:** 13th level_\r\nWhen you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 force points and forgo one of your attacks to cast an at-will force power which requires you to make a melee weapon attack.\r\n\r\n### Kinetic Mastery\r\n_**Path of Iron:** 18th level_\r\nChoose a lightsaber form you know. Once on each of your turns, you can use the chosen form without using your bonus action. \r\n\r\nYou can do so six times. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 force point to use it.\r\n\r\n## Path of Meditation\r\nThroughout the Force, there is both symphonic harmony, and discordant chaos. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Meditation embody these concepts, empowering their allies and hindering their enemies through the use of the ancient Force technique of battle meditation.\r\n\r\n### Sage Counsel\r\n_**Path of Meditation:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn the *guidance* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, this power's die increases by one step (from d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Allies\r\n_**Path of Meditation:** 3rd level_\r\nWhile you are concentrating on a power that benefits a friendly creature other than you, you gain new ways to utilize your Force-Empowered Self features. Each option costs 1 force point, and you can only target a creature that is benefiting from a power you cast.\r\n\r\n#### Deflection\r\nWhen an ally is hit with an attack roll, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to add it to your ally's AC, potentially causing the attack to miss.\r\n\r\n#### Double Strike\r\nWhen an ally hits with an attack roll, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to deal additional damage of the same type as the attack.\r\n\r\n#### Slow Time\r\nWhen an ally moves on their turn, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to increase their speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of the turn.\r\n\r\n### Unbreakable Focus\r\n_**Path of Meditation:** 7th level_\r\nOnce per long rest, you can cast the *battle meditation* force power at its base level without expending force points. While concentrating on *battle meditation*, at the start of each of your turns, the power's die increases by one step (from d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\r\n\r\n### Turbulent Presence\r\n_**Path of Meditation:** 13th level_\r\nOnce per long rest, you can cast the *improved battle meditation* force power at its base level without expending force points. While concentrating on *improved battle meditation*, at the start of each of your turns, the power's die increases by one step (from d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).\r\n\r\n&emsp;Additionally, once per round, when a creature rolls a bonus or penalty die from an effect you control, you can have them roll the die with advantage or disadvantage (your choice).\r\n\r\n### Legendary Battle Meditation\r\n_**Path of Meditation:** 18th level_\r\nOnce per long rest, you can cast the *master battle meditation* force power without expending force points. While concentrating on *master battle meditation*, at the start of each of your turns, the power's die increases by one step (from d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you gain a second reaction each round that you can only use for your Force-Empowered Allies feature. You can only take one reaction per turn.\r\n\r\n## Path of Synthesis\r\nThere is power in diversity unknown to those of narrow mind. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Synthesis blend their intricate mastery of the Force with their understanding of technology, creating unique effects to overcome their obstacles.\r\n\r\n### Techcasting Secrets\r\n_**Path of Synthesis:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have learned to intersperse your training with an aptitude for technology. Choose two tech powers of 1st level or lower. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the sentinel table. \r\n\r\nAt 7th level, you learn two tech powers of 2nd level or lower. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 3rd level or lower. At 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 4th level or lower. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of no higher than the level determined by this feature.\r\n\r\n### Synthetic Understanding\r\n_**Path of Synthesis:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've applied your newfound knowledge to broader pursuits. You gain proficiency in Technology or one tool of your choice.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, or a check with a tool, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\nFinally, when you deal damage with a tech power or your Double Strike Force Empowered Self option, you can choose to substitute the damage dealt as ion.\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Tech\r\n_**Path of Synthesis:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to fully blend your technological aptitude with your use of the Force. You have three such effects: Disruption Pulse, Force Override, and Techcasting Insight. When you use your Force-Empowered Tech, you choose which effect to create.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Disruption Pulse\r\nAs an action, you can send out a 30 foot cone of electromagnetically-charged energy to overload enemy weapons. Each creature within the cone that is wearing or carrying a weapon with electric components must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the weapon is being worn, this save is made with disadvantage. On a failed save, the first attack they attempt to make with that weapon has disadvantage. A creature with multiple weapons must make a separate save for each weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Forced Override\r\nWhen you cast a tech power that requires a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the save (no action required).\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Insight\r\nAs an action, you can attempt to determine another creature's experience with techcasting. When you do so, you make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If you succeed, you immediately learn the target's techcasting Max Power Level, as well as any tech powers currently affecting the target.\r\n\r\n### Improved Force-Empowered Tech\r\n_**Path of Synthesis:** 13th level_\r\nYou've gained access to two additional Force-Empowered Tech effects: Harmonic Synthesis and Conservation of Energy.\r\n\r\n#### Harmonic Synthesis\r\nWhen you use your action to cast a force power, you can use your bonus action to gain resistance to damage dealt by tech powers until the start of your next turn. If you use your action to cast a tech power, you can instead gain resistance to damage dealt by force powers.\r\n\r\n#### Conservation of Energy\r\nWhen you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a tech power, you can reduce the force point cost of the tech power to 0 (no action required).\r\n\r\n### Reflective Shield\r\n_**Path of Synthesis:** 18th level_\r\nWhen you use your Force-Empowered Tech features, a barrier for energy shimmers into existence, surrounding you until the end of your next turn. When you take damage, you can mitigate the incoming energy and potentially reflect it back at your attacker. You use your reaction to have resistance against the triggering damage, and if the source of the damage is within 5 feet of you, they take half of the total damage dealt as ion.\r\n\r\n## Path of Tenacity\r\nThe tenacious are ever mindful that the Force ebbs and flows, and uses this knowledge to great advantage. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Tenacity use their connection to the Force to draw the opposition's attention while also warding off their attacks, serving as an effective bulwark against even the most implacable of foes.\r\n\r\n### Protector\r\n_**Path of Tenacity:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn the *saber ward* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, when you cast it, you can spend 2 force points to extend the benefits to creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you while the power is active. The creatures immediately lose this benefit if they move more than 5 feet away from you.\r\n\r\n### Kinetic Ward\r\n_**Path of Tenacity:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can use your reaction to deflect a strike when you are dealt damage by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your sentinel level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 force point to make a melee weapon attack at a target within 5 feet of you with the weapon, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and if the attack hits it uses your Kinetic Combat die for its damage roll. If *saber ward* is active, you have advantage on the attack roll.\r\n\r\n### Kinetic Bulwark\r\n_**Path of Tenacity:** 7th level_\r\nYou can extend your Kinetic Ward to a creature within 5 feet of you when they are hit by a melee weapon attack. If this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. \r\n\r\n### Indomitable\r\n_**Path of Tenacity:** 13th level_\r\nThe Force flowing through you makes it harder for movement to be forced upon you. You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being grappled or moved. If you fail the saving throw or ability check, you can spend 1 force point to reroll one of the dice once. You must use the new roll.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if allies within 5 feet of you are gaining the benefit of your *saber ward* force power, they also gain the benefit of this feature.\r\n\r\n### Kinetic Bastion\r\n_**Path of Tenacity:** 18th level_\r\nYou can protect allies even further from you. When a creature within 30 feet of you is hit by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to them and extend your Kinetic Ward. If this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. \r\n\r\nYou can use this feature six times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n## Path of Witchcraft\r\n\r\nThe Force connects all living things. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Witchcraft use that connection to summon the aid of nature, both spirits and the elements, adapting them to their will.\r\n\r\n### Wild Power\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn the *enfeeble* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use the Double Strike Force-Empowered Self option when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to damage rolls with it.\r\n\r\n### Ichor Conjuring\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd and 11th level_\r\nYou learn to call on the spirits of beasts and grant them ichorous form. Once on each of your turns, when you cast a force power and deal necrotic damage to a creature, you can conjure a familiar within 5 feet of it (no action required). The familiar takes the form of a humanoid or beast made of green, glowing smoke, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another spirit, or until you're incapacitated or die.\r\n\r\nYour familiar has an AC equal to your universal force save DC, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you regardless of its appearance, and it occupies its own space. On your turn, you can mentally command the familiar to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your familiar is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. While you have a familiar, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- As a bonus action, you can use your magicks to teleport, swapping places with your familiar at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.\r\n- When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the familiar's space. You make this choice for each attack.\r\n- When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your familiar moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the familiar's space.\r\n\r\nStarting at 11th level, you can summon your familiar when you deal damage with any force power, instead of just necrotic. Additionally, you can summon your familiar when you use a Force-Empowered Self option on your turn.\r\n\r\n### Nature's Vigor\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 7th level_\r\nYou've learned to attune your senses with nature. If you spend at least 1 minute meditating while in nature, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:\r\n- You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.\r\n- You can understand plants within 30 feet of you. They can telepathically communicate simple ideas to you, including memories from within the past day.\r\n- You can command plants within 30 feet of you to create difficult terrain, or other tasks at the GM's discretion (no action required).\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Waters of Life\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 13th and 17th level_\r\nYou've learned to absorb the fleeting magicks of your familiar. When your familiar is destroyed by taking damage, you can choose to grant temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) to one friendly creature of your choice you can see within 30 feet.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Stormcaller\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 18th level_\r\nYou've learned to command the elements to summon a fierce storm in a 30-foot radius around you. As an action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\r\n- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.\r\n- You have resistance to energy, lightning, and necrotic damage.\r\n- Whenever a hostile creature enters this radius for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 10 lightning damage.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n## Path of Witchcraft (Companion)\r\n\r\nThe Force connects all living things. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Witchcraft use that connection to summon the aid of nature, both beasts and the elements, adapting them to their will.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in Animal Handling.\r\n\r\n### Wild Power\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn the *enfeeble* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use the Double Strike Force-Empowered Self option when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to damage rolls with it.\r\n\r\n### Beast Companion\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to create a powerful bond through the Force with your own  beast companion.\r\n\r\nCreate your beast companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its traits and features, your beast companion gains an additional benefit while it is bonded to you:\r\n- Your beast gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each beast trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your force point maximum is reduced by 2. \r\n\r\nLastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, your beast companion gains the following benefits:\r\n- When you use a Force-Empowered Self option to increase your speed or armor class, you can instead grant this bonus to your beast companion. \r\n\r\n- You and your beast companion can communicate telepathically, though your beast companion can only communicate in and understand simple concepts.\r\n\r\nThis radius increases to 30 feet at 11th level, and 60 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Nature's Vigor\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 7th level_\r\nYou've learned to attune your senses with nature. If you spend at least 1 minute meditating while in nature, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:\r\n- You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.\r\n- You can understand plants within 30 feet of you. They can telepathically communicate simple ideas to you, including memories from within the past day.\r\n- You can command plants within 30 feet of you to create difficult terrain, or other tasks at the GM's discretion (no action required).\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Beastwarden\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 13th and 17th level_\r\nYour bond with your beast companion strengthens, granting the following benefits while your beast companion is within 30 feet of you:\r\n- When you cast a force power that targets only yourself, and your beast companion is within range, you can also target your beast companion with that power. \r\n- If you or your beast have darkvision and the other doesn't, the other gains it with the same radius. If you both have darkvision, you both use the larger radius of the two, which then increases by 30 feet.\r\n- If you or your beast have advantage on Perception checks and the other doesn't, the other gains advantage on Perception checks. If you both have advantage on Perception checks, when either of you makes a Perception check with advantage, you can reroll one of the dice once.\r\n\r\nThis radius increases to 60 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Stormcaller\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 18th level_\r\nYou've learned to command the elements to summon a fierce storm in a 30-foot radius around you. As an action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\r\n- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.\r\n- You have resistance to energy, lightning, and necrotic damage.\r\n- Whenever a hostile creature enters this radius for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 10 lightning damage.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

You stagger onto the streets and find a nearby alley in which you empty the night's contents. To many, the next morning's hangovers would be hell. To you, they're a ritual.\r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Performance, Persuasion, and Sleight of Hand\r\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** Your choice of any gaming set, brewer's kit, or spicer's kit\r\n- **Languages:** One of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** A chance cube set, a sabaac deck, 2 days field rations, a flask or belt pouch containing your addiction, a set of common clothes, a bedroll, and a belt pouch containing 25 cr\r\n\r\n#### Pick Your Poison\r\nWhile most addicts are willing to try everything once, they typically have a drug of choice. You can determine what the source of your addiction or determine it randomly below.\r\n\r\n|d16|Substance of Choice|\r\n|:---:|:----------:|\r\n|1|Deuterium-pyro|\t\r\n|2|Mummergy|\r\n|3|Novanian grog|\t\r\n|4|Raava|\r\n|5|Spicebrew|\r\n|6|Tihaar|\r\n|7|Tsiraki|\r\n|8|Vayerbok|\r\n\r\n|d16|Substance of Choice|\r\n|:---:|:----------:|\r\n|9|Andris|\r\n|10|Cilona|\r\n|11|Giggledust|\r\n|12|Glitterstim|\r\n|13|Karrak|\r\n|14|Muon gold|\t\r\n|15|Yaladai|\r\n|16|Yarrock|\r\n\r\n### Feature: Addicted\r\nYou've been abusing substances for a long time. You always know who to talk to and where to find substances, and you can often identify them in their raw form. \r\n\r\n### Background Feat\r\nAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|Silver-Tongued|\r\n|2|Performer|\r\n|3|Charmer|\r\n|4|Quick-Fingered|\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|Competitor|\r\n|6|Specialist|\r\n|7|Linguist|\r\n|8|Durable|\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nAddicts can be rude and uncouth, wearing their addiction visibly, or they might hide that addiction and appear to function normally. Importantly, and varying with every addict, why are you addicted? To forget the past? To drown your sorrows? Or are you simply chasing the dragon?\r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|I am guaranteed to fight someone if I'm drunk/high enough.|\r\n|2|Life is pain. All I want is to drink/smoke myself into nothingness.|\r\n|3|I have a simple rule; life's a party, so grab the deathsticks!|\r\n|4|The only thing keeping me from burning down this village is the fact that you make some damn good spice.|\r\n|5|I'm quite reserved until the moment I fulfill my addictive needs.|\r\n|6|This stuff is a bit weak, do you have anything higher than 60% in the back?|\r\n|7|I take pride in my addiction and am often snobbish when talking about it.|\r\n|8|I blow up at the slightest insult.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Ideal|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|**Hope.** I hope to one day be free of my addiction.

I take drugs in the hopes they will be.|\r\n|3|I hope to start a drug business myself and give people the same happiness I've found.|\r\n|4|Everything I do is in the hopes of getting my hands on my drug.|\r\n|5|I traded my former self to my addiction. Now I need to find a way to get him back.|\r\n|6| To be addicted is to be truly alive.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Flaw|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|This could be rough, let's take something before we go.|\r\n|2|Hopefully this will be the one to end it.|\r\n|3|The mission can wait, we should find some dealers first.|\r\n|4|What? I don't have a problem. You're the one with the problem!|\r\n|5|It looks like my drug, so it should be safe to take right?|\r\n|6|I'm never myself when I'm on it.|\r\n\r\n## Amnesiac\r\n\r\nOne day you awoke, perhaps in a forest or on a sandy beach, with no recollection of what happened to you. How did you get here? Who were you? These questions elude and boggle your mind. Some people wish for a fresh start, but you never even got a choice.\r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Investigation, and Survival \r\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** Choose one from disguise kit, forgery kit, or tinker's implements\r\n- **Languages:** One of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a relic of your past which you do not remember, and a belt pouch containing 200 cr\r\n\r\n> #### Variant: Randomized Proficiencies\r\n> Rather than taking the proficiencies provided by this background, you can choose to take no proficiencies, instead waiting to gain a proficiency during a story moment. When you do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 check. You add your proficiency bonus to this check, but no additional modifiers. On a success, you gain the chosen skill, tool, or language proficiency. On a failure, you do not gain a proficiency, and you can't attempt again for 24 hours. You can gain no more than two skill proficiencies and two tool or language proficiencies in this way.\r\n\r\n### Feature: A Life Once Lived\r\nYou once had a home, a family, relationships, possessions, but now you are left with nothing but the ability to start anew. You are unfamiliar with the world around you as well as the people in it. You may often need to ask for clarification on things other adventurers may know intrinsically. Some events, locations, names, phrases, or objects may also trigger you to recall small details which could relate to the life you once had, at the discretion of the GM.\r\n\r\n### Background Feat\r\nAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|Silver-Tongued|\r\n|2|Empathic|\r\n|3|Investigator|\r\n|4|Survivalist|\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|Specialist|\r\n|6|Crafter|\r\n|7|Linguist|\r\n|8|Practiced|\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nThe important things to consider when choosing this background are how your character has dealt with starting life anew and what have they done to set down that path.\r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|I don't know who you are but I'll try to help you.|\r\n|2|I will let nothing stop my quest for answers.|\r\n|3|Even if I never find out who I was before, I will know who I am now.|\r\n|4|I am sometimes clumsy when speaking. I must've not been very eloquent.|\r\n|5|I shy away from forging new relationships. I don't want to leave anyone behind again.|\r\n|6|Having no memories of the past has left me feeling free and happy.|\r\n|7|I am eager to learn and devour any knowledge I can.|\r\n|8|I am insightful and can often see things from other peoples point of view.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Ideal|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|**Conscience.** I've forgotten before, I can forget again.  I don't let my conscience get in the way of my actions. (Lawful)|\r\n|2|**Freedom.** With no past to tie me down I do was I will. (Chaotic)|\r\n|3|**Respect.** People deserve to be treated with respect. (Light)|\r\n|4|**Past.** I will destroy whatever I have to in order to reclaim what I once had. (Dark)|\r\n|5|**Live and Let Live.** Ideals aren't worth killing over or going to war for. (Neutral)|\r\n|6|**Memory.** Finding out my history drives every action I do. (Any)|\r\n\r\n|d6|Bond|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|I will never rest until I find out what happened to me.|\r\n|2|I have a family out there who's looking for me. I can't let them down.|\r\n|3|I was given a chance to start fresh, and I'm not taking it for granted.|\r\n|4|My entire life was lost in the blink of an eye. What's the point of all this?|\r\n|5|I've already lost everything. Now I do as I please.|\r\n|6|I will become something great so that even if I forget, others won't.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Flaw|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|I've lost all hope since I woke up.|\r\n|2|I'm obsessed with the life I left behind.|\r\n|3|Sometimes I crack under the stress of starting new.|\r\n|4|I get tunnel vision when investigating my past life.|\r\n|5|I no longer care about anything. It could all be gone in an instant.|\r\n|6|I am constantly angry about forgetting everything.|\r\n\r\n## Archaeologist\r\n\r\nAn archaeologist learns about the long-lost and fallen cultures of the past by studying their remains \ufffd their bones, their ruins, their surviving masterworks, and their tombs. Those who practice archaeology travel to the far corners of the world to root through crumbled cities and lost dungeons, digging in search of artifacts that might tell the stories of monarchs and high priests, wars and cataclysms.\r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Investigation, Lore, Perception, or Survival\r\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** Surveyor's implements or scavenging kit\r\n- **Languages:** One of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** A case containing a physical or digital map to a ruin or dungeon, a lantern, a vibropick, a set of traveler's clothes, a shovel, a two-person tent, a trinket recovered from a dig site, and a pouch containing 250 cr\r\n\r\n#### Dust Digger\r\nPrior to becoming an adventurer, you spent most of your young life crawling around in the dust, pilfering relics of questionable value from crypts and ruins. Though you managed to sell a few of your discoveries and earn enough credits to buy proper adventuring gear, you have held onto an item that has great emotional value to you. You can determine your signature item or determine it randomly below.\r\n\r\n|d8|Signature Item|\r\n|:---:|:----------:|\r\n|1|10-foot pole|\t\r\n|2|Hat|\r\n|3|Hammer|\t\r\n|4|Lantern|\r\n\r\n|d8|Signature Item|\r\n|:---:|:----------:|\r\n|5|Medallion|\r\n|6|Prybar|\r\n|7|Shovel|\r\n|8|Whip|\r\n\r\n### Feature: Historical Knowledge\r\nWhen you enter a ruin or dungeon, you can correctly ascertain its original purpose and determine its builders, whether those were jedi, sith, hutts, rakata, or some other known species or civilization. Additionally, you can readily determine the value of ancient art.\r\n\r\n### Background Feat\r\nAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|Investigator|\r\n|2|Loremaster|\r\n|3|Perceptive|\r\n|4|Survivalist|\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|Crafter|\r\n|6|Specialist|\r\n|7|Linguist|\r\n|8|Dungeon Delver|\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nFew archaeologists can resist the lure of an unexplored ruin or dungeon, particularly if such a site is the source of legends or is rumored to contain noteworthy relics. Whatever their motivations, they combine the likes of a dutiful historian with those of a dogged scoundrel.\r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|I love a good puzzle or mystery.|\r\n|2|I'm a pack rat who never throws anything away.|\r\n|3|Fame is more important to me than money.|\r\n|4|I have no qualms about stealing from the dead.|\r\n|5|I'm happier in a dusty old tomb than I am in the centers of civilization.|\r\n|6|Traps don't make me nervous. Idiots who trigger traps make me nervous.|\r\n|7|I might fail, but I will never give up.|\r\n|8|You might think I'm a scholar, but I love a good brawl. These fists were made for punching.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Ideal|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|**Preservation.** That artifact belongs in a museum. (Light)|\r\n|2|**Greed.** I won't risk my life for nothing. I expect some kind of payment. (Any)|\r\n|3|**Death Wish.** Nothing is more exhilarating than a narrow escape from the jaws of death. (Chaotic)|\r\n|4|**Dignity.** The dead and their belongings deserve to be treated with respect. (Lawful)|\r\n|5|**Immortality.** All my exploring is part of a plan to find the secret of everlasting life. (Any)|\r\n|6|**Danger.** With every great discovery comes grave danger. The two walk hand in hand. (Any)|\r\n\r\n|d6|Bond|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|Ever since I was a child, I've heard stories about a lost city. I aim to find it, learn its secrets, and earn my place in the history books.|\r\n|2|I want to find my mentor, who disappeared on an expedition some time ago.|\r\n|3|I have a friendly rival. Only one of us can be the best, and I aim to prove it's me.|\r\n|4|I won't sell an art object or other treasure that has historical significance or is one of a kind.|\r\n|5|I'm secretly in love with the wealthy patron who sponsors my archaeological exploits.|\r\n|6|I hope to bring prestige to an library, a museum, or a university.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Flaw|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|I have a secret fear of some common wild animal, and in my work, I see them everywhere.|\r\n|2|I can't leave a room without searching it for secret doors.|\r\n|3|When I'm not exploring dungeons or ruins, I get jittery and impatient.|\r\n|4|I have no time for friends or family. I spend every waking moment thinking about and preparing for my next expedition.|\r\n|5|When given the choice of going left or right, I always go left.|\r\n|6|I can't sleep except in total darkness.|\r\n\r\n## Barbarian\r\nThough you might have only recently arrived in civilized lands, you are no stranger to the values of cooperation and group effort when striving for supremacy. You learned these principles, and much more, as a member of your tribe.\r\n\r\nYour people have always tried to hold to the old ways. Tradition and taboo have kept your tribe strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why your tribe chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of your tribe led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization.\r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Nature, and Survival\r\n- **Tool Proficiencies**: One type of musical instrument or artisan's implements\r\n- **Languages:** One of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** A hunting trap, a totemic token or set of tattoos marking your loyalty to your tribe, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 100 cr\r\n\r\n### Feature: Barbarian Heritage\r\nYou have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the worlds. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can call upon the hospitality of other tribes in times of need.\r\n\r\n### Background Feat\r\nAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|Animal Handler|\r\n|2|Brawny|\r\n|3|Naturalist|\r\n|4|Survivalist|\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|Entertainer|\r\n|6|Crafter|\r\n|7|Athlete|\r\n|8|Weapon Expert|\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nOften considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, barbarians have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders. \r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.|\r\n|2|I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.|\r\n|3|I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn my clan of an approaching horde. I'd do it again if I had to.|\r\n|4|I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.|\r\n|5|I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry rancor.|\r\n|6|I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them.|\r\n|7|I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.|\r\n|8|I was, in fact, raised by wampas.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Ideal|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|**Change.** Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. (Chaotic)|\r\n|2|**Greater Good.** It is each person's responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe. (Light)|\r\n|3|**Honor.** If I dishonor myself, I dishonor my whole clan.

You might or might not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position.\r\n\r\nYou might have been one of the many functionaries, attendants, and other hangers-on in Coruscant's upper echelons, or perhaps you traveled in Nar Shaddaa's baroque and sometimes cutthroat conglomeration of factions, nobles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or functionaries on Dromund Kaas, or you might have grown up on some other affluent planet.\r\n\r\nEven if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.\r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Performance, and Survival\r\n- **Languages:** Two of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** A set of fine clothes and a pouch containing 150 cr\r\n\r\n### Feature: Court Functionality\r\nYour knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter.

Your ideal might be concerned with the prevailing philosophy of your court or organization.\r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right.

Everywhere I go, I'm surrounded by rivals.|\r\n\r\n## Crime Lord\r\nFew societies manage to eradicate crime altogether. In the underworld, someone always rises to the top, either through vision, organisation, or sheer intimidation. The life of a crime lord isn't for the timid. After conquering an unseen empire, the crime lord wages a daily struggle not only to stay on top, but also to stay alive.\r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Intimidation, and Persuasion\r\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set\r\n- **Languages:** One of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** A fine set of clothes, a gaming set (one of your choice), and a purse containing 250 cr\r\n\r\n#### Criminal Motivation\r\nNot every crime lord is bent on corrupting society and making a profit. Some use their criminal connections to wage guerilla wars against tyrants and despots. Indeed, some historical heroes began as smugglers or pirates, rising through the ranks of their organization to provide a more noble direction for their group's activities. Although some did so to remove an obstacle to making more money, others recognized that ridding the galaxy of evil is a more important long-term goal. Choose the motivation behind your criminal enterprise, or roll on the table below.\r\n\r\n|d8|Motivation|\r\n|:---:|:----------:|\r\n|1|Desperation|\r\n|2|Freedom|\r\n|3|Infamy|\r\n|4|Love|\r\n\r\n|d8|Motivation|\r\n|:---:|:----------:|\r\n|5|Malice|\r\n|6|Profit|\r\n|7|Respect|\r\n|8|Revenge|\r\n\r\n### Feature: Criminal Network\r\nYou have access to an extensive network of organised crime.

But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. Unlike common thieves, some crime lords even have some respect for law and authority, with whom they play a cat-and-mouse type game. \r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.|\r\n|2|I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let me emotions control me.|\r\n|3|My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.|\r\n|4|I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.|\r\n|5|I don't like to get my hands dirty, and I won't be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.|\r\n|6|My favor, once lost, is lost forever.|\r\n|7|If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields.|\r\n|8|I blow up at the slightest insult.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Ideal|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|**Honor.** I don't steal from others in the trade.

I'm okay with that.|\r\n\r\n## Dathomir Witch\r\nYou are a part of one of the many Force-sensitive clans on Dathomir. You and your sisters, under the guidance of the Clan Mother, form powerful connections with one another and the untamed wilds of the planet. Your people are a matriarchal society of warriors who train in the art of war and the usage of both muscle and the Force in combat. While all clans have their own set of rules regarding Force usage, all the clans held one rule above all others: *\"Never Concede to Evil.\"*\r\n\r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Lore, and Nature\r\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** Bioanalysis kit\r\n- **Languages:** One of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** A copy of your clan's book of laws, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 150 cr\r\n\r\n#### Witch Clans\r\nDathomir culture is built on the backbone of various clans. The clan you are a part of has it's own history, allegiances, and feuds which shape your persepctive. Choose an option or roll on the table below to determine your clan.\r\n\r\n|d8|Clan|\r\n|:---:|:----------:|\r\n|1|Singing Mountain|\r\n|2|Misty Falls|\r\n|3|Red Hills|\r\n|4|Dreaming River|\r\n\r\n|d8|Clan|\r\n|:---:|:----------:|\r\n|5|Frenzied River|\r\n|6|Great Canyon|\r\n|7|Nightsisters|\r\n|8|Nightbrothers|\r\n\r\n### Feature: Matriarchal Society\r\nOther Dathomir Witches know, and will look out for you. If you're ever in need of a place to stay, or a meal to eat, other Dathomir Witches will help you as long as your clans aren't feuding. This could be in the form of shelters, meals, even healing. If the Dathomir Witches are of your clan or a clan friendly to you, they may be willing to help you even at cost to themselves. \r\n\r\n### Background Feat\r\nAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|Acrobat|\r\n|2|Animal Handler|\r\n|3|Loremaster|\r\n|4|Naturalist|\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|Specialist|\r\n|6|Linguist|\r\n|7|Force-Sensitive|\r\n|8|Force of Personality|\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nDathomir Witches are shaped by their training. They study their book of laws and use it to uphold order and prevent one's turn to the dark side. Their clan and the people around them affects their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.\r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|I try and bring my culture to outsiders.|\r\n|2|I always put my clan first.|\r\n|3|I follow my clan's book of law to the letter.|\r\n|4|I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn my clan of an approaching rival clan.

It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish.|\r\n\r\n## Ex-Cultist\r\n\r\nOnce you served alongside your fellow neophytes. You worshiped at altars to a deific entity, performed the sacraments and adorned yourself in the proper fashion. You basked in this dark glory with your fellows as you served this higher, malign power. But, something changed. Now, you wander the world outside of isolated circle of brethren, either unwillingly or of your own volition. \r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Intimidation, Investigation, or Lore\r\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** Poisoner's kit\r\n- **Languages:** One of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes including a robe, a symbol of devotion, a copy of a blasphemous holy text, a curved ritual knife, a poisoner's kit, and a belt pouch containing 50 cr\r\n\r\n#### Change of Heart\r\nWhy did you walk away from the world you knew? Was this a choice you made, or did fate separate you from your fellow devotees? Do you wish to undo the evil that your cult perpetuated, or would you rejoin your cult if given the chance? \r\n\r\n|d4|Change of Heart|\r\n|:---:|:----------:|\r\n|1|I witnessed a particularly gruesome rite and ran for my life.|\r\n|2|I asked the wrong kind of questions. The others planned to sacrifice me to our dark lord, but I escaped.|\r\n|3|The others took their own lives to ascend. I could not.|\r\n|4|I no longer believed in what we were doing. It seemed wrong, somehow.|\r\n\r\n### Feature: Secret Signs\r\nYou know the secret symbology of your cult, which can pop up in some surprising places. With a subtle gesture or knowing handshake you can discern who follows the ways of your dark lord.

Thing.|\r\n|2|The world is so exciting! Now I can do things previously forbidden like drinking wine or wearing shoes.|\r\n|3|The dark lord used to order us to do everything. It's a little hard for me to live without that.|\r\n|4|If my friends will let me, I'll openly reminisce about my old days in the cult all day long.|\r\n|5|I can't help but check the holy scriptures for advice about any given situation.|\r\n|6|It's not the end of the world.

The lore of my cult is historically important, and I should preserve it. (Neutral)|\r\n|6|**Revision**. The cult failed because the holy book was wrong. I must learn about the outside world, and fix the book's errors. (Any)|\r\n\r\n|d6|Bond|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|I must discover the truth behind my dark lord, even if it kills me.|\r\n|2|I need to reconnect with the people from my life before the cult, if I can ever find them.|\r\n|3|I must free other people from unwitting service to dark masters.|\r\n|4|A monstrous, immortal guardian of the cult is hunting me.

Due to the circumstances of how you were raised, you have been involved with wandering heroes for most of your life.

You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order.

If you are accused of a crime, your faction will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the faction, if you are a member in good standing. You must pay dues of 50 cr per month to the faction.

You don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others. Your faction might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the galaxy. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant's life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.\r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Performance, and Persuasion\r\n- **Languages:** Two of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** A letter of introduction from your faction, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr\r\n\r\n#### Faction Business\r\nfactions are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade.

You have spent a lot of time surviving outside population centers, but know how to sell your product either directly or to merchants, legal or otherwise.

This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your A Champion Well Known feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment\ufffdperhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. \r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, and Performance\r\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument\r\n- **Languages:** One of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** A trophy earned via some sort of competition, clothing suitable to your profession, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr\r\n\r\n### Feature: A Champion Well Known\r\nYou can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.\r\n\r\n### Background Feat\r\nAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|Acrobat|\r\n|2|Brawny|\r\n|3|Threatening|\r\n|4|Performer|\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|Entertainer|\r\n|6|Linguist|\r\n|7|Athlete|\r\n|8|Durable|\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nSuccessful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an audience's attention, so they tend to have flamboyant or forceful personalities.

(Dark)|\r\n|5|**People.** I like seeing the smiles on people's faces when I perform. That's all that matters.

(Any)|\r\n\r\n|d6|Bond|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|My instrument is my most treasured possession, and it reminds me of someone I love.|\r\n|2|Someone stole my precious trophy, and someday I'll get it back.|\r\n|3|I want to be famous, whatever it takes.|\r\n|4|I idolize a hero of the old tales and measure my deeds against that person's.|\r\n|5|I will do anything to prove myself superior to my hated rival.|\r\n|6|I would do anything for the other members of my old troupe.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Flaw|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|I'll do anything to win fame and renown.|\r\n|2|I'm a sucker for a pretty face.|\r\n|3|A scandal prevents me from ever going home again. That kind of trouble seems to follow me around.|\r\n|4|I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat.|\r\n|5|I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble.|\r\n|6|Despite my best efforts, I am unreliable to my friends.|\r\n\r\n## Hermit\r\nYou lived in seclusion\ufffdeither in a community or alone\ufffdfor a formative part of your life.

The nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. You might have discovered a great truth about the cosmos or the Force, a fact that has long been forgotten, a relic of the past that could rewrite history, or a place unseen for ages. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society. Work with your GM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.\r\n\r\n### Background Feat\r\nAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|Animal Handler|\r\n|2|Loremaster|\r\n|3|Medic|\r\n|4|Naturalist|\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|Specialist|\r\n|6|Alert|\r\n|7|Dungeon Delver|\r\n|8|Healer|\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nSome hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. Some few are driven slightly mad by their isolation.\r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|I've been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.|\r\n|2|I am utterly serene, even in the face of disaster.|\r\n|3|The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom.|\r\n|4|I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer.|\r\n|5|I'm oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.|\r\n|6|I connect everything that happens to me to a grand, cosmic plan.|\r\n|7|I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.|\r\n|8|I am working on a grand philosophical theory and love sharing my ideas.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Ideal|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|**Greater Good.** My gifts are meant to be shared with all, not used for my own benefit.

I must someday confront them.|\r\n|3|I'm still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion, and it still eludes me.|\r\n|4|I entered seclusion because I loved someone I could not have.|\r\n|5|Should my discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.|\r\n|6|My isolation gave me great insight into a great Dark that only I can destroy.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Flaw|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|Now that I've returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much.|\r\n|2|I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell.|\r\n|3|I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy.|\r\n|4|I let my need to win arguments overshadow friendships and harmony.|\r\n|5|I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge.|\r\n|6|I like keeping secrets and won't share them with anyone.|\r\n\r\n## Holonet Technician\r\nYou worked to keep the holonet up and running, whether being employed directly by an institution or indirectly by people across the galaxy.

This information comes in the form of useful (and sometimes sensitive) information on a topic you choose each day to tune into; this information isn't always reliable or interesting. Regardless of the quality of the information, it's relevance most likely pertains to your locale.\r\n\r\n### Background Feat\r\nAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|Empathic|\r\n|2|Investigator|\r\n|3|Stealthy|\r\n|4|Techie|\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|Specialist|\r\n|6|Keen Mind|\r\n|7|Practiced|\r\n|8|Tech Dabbler|\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nHolonets technicians vary from boring officer worker to criminal information broker.   \r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|I watch and record people secretly then review it later.|\r\n|2|I talk like I'm on a game show or am a holonet broadcaster at all times.|\r\n|3|I prefer to be left to my own devices.|\r\n|4|I like to record people dying and upload it to the holonet.|\r\n|5|There's no such thing as 'real news'.|\r\n|6|Information is a weapon that I've mastered.|\r\n|7|I am always interested in learning new things.|\r\n|8|I prefer interacting indirectly.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Ideal|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|**Duty.** It is my duty to keep all people in contact so that everything will continue working as intended.

Your order combines the teachings of the Jedi with the creed of the Royal Guard of old, using the Force as a powerful and respected tool with which to serve the Force as embodied by your Emperor. Imperial Knights do not share the philosophies of the Jedi with regards to the Force and its light side, and are well aware of the dangers of the dark side, dutifully rejecting its use and temptations. \r\n\r\nWhile Imperial Knights wield and construct their own lightsabers, they assign them no ceremonial value, treating them as nothing more than tools. As such, almost all lightsabers of the Imperial Knights look the same, with uniform hilt design and signature silver blades. These blades are produced by synthetic crystals similar to the red variety used by the Sith, created with knowledge from Emperor Palpatine's *Book of Anger*, but in a process bereft of the dark side. Imperial Knights are also recognized by their crimson armor emblazoned with the insignia of the Empire and ideally crafted of lightsaber-resistant materials.\r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, or Piloting\r\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** Armormech's implements and artificer's implements\r\n- **Equipment:** a revised copy of the *Book of Anger*, an Imperial insignia, a black cape with a hood, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr\r\n\r\n### Feature: Will of the Emperor\r\nThe authority granted by your position is easily acknowledged even by those who don't recognize the Imperial Knights. Though they might not know you, common citizens will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.\r\n\r\n### Background Feat\r\nAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|Brawny|\r\n|2|Threatening|\r\n|3|Perceptive|\r\n|4|Ace Pilot|\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|Crafter|\r\n|6|Force-Sensitive|\r\n|7|Armor Expert|\r\n|8|Weapon Expert|\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nImperial Knights are warriors first, not negotiators. Their bonds are shaped by the great value they put in teamwork with their fellow Knights, as well as their loyalty to their Emperor. Their flaws may lie in their hubris, sense of superiority, or overzealousness in banishing the dark side. Some Knights hold ideals that lie beyond their order, for better or worse.\r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|If a crisis comes, my place will be at the Emperor's side.|\r\n|2|I dislike my title. It is only there to make me seem more important than I am.|\r\n|3|I do not lead. I only advise.|\r\n|4|Some things are more important than the life of any one person\ufffdincluding mine.|\r\n|5|I will not bend, I will not break, I will not serve.|\r\n|6|I will not strike an enemy down in anger.|\r\n|7|I can do whatever needs to be done!|\r\n|8|I've wanted to test myself against the Sith!|\r\n\r\n|d6|Ideal|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|**Duty.** We serve with honor and if we are asked to sacrifice our honor as our duty, then we are betrayed. (Lawful)|\r\n|2|**Loyalty.** I do not understand, sire. But I will obey. (Lawful)|\r\n|3|**Faith.** I will not stray from the true path. I feel the responsibility that comes with wielding the Force now more than ever. (Light)|\r\n|4|**Prudence.** Where I come from, we at least hear someone out before we shoot them. (Neutral)|\r\n|5|**Pride.** We are Imperial Knights. There are none better. (Any)|\r\n|6|**Strategy.** A tiny fever wasp can carry death into places where a Krayt dragon cannot go. (Any)|\r\n\r\n|d6|Bond|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|Our duty is to the Force as embodied by the Emperor.|\r\n|2|There is a person I care more about than my vows as a Knight or my loyalty to the Empire.|\r\n|3|I might, by strength of my own will, develop my own creations.|\r\n|4|I will not allow another who has risen in my defense to be killed!|\r\n|5|My friend is not the most orthodox of Knights. I've learned a lot from her.|\r\n|6|I had a mentor, who was willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Flaw|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|My passion is my strength\ufffdmy passion is my weakness. So my Master always told me.|\r\n|2|It was by the will of the Force my accident maimed me.|\r\n|3|Sometimes we must sacrifice those who need us for the greater good.|\r\n|4|The penalty for desertion has always been death.|\r\n|5|I envy the freedom of others, but I'm not walking away from my responsibilities.|\r\n|6|I can no longer be a Knight. I've become... something else.|\r\n\r\n## Independent Droid\r\n\r\nYou were once a machine, designed for a very specific task, with no mind of your own. You followed orders, never questioning the tasks assigned to you, often the mundane tasks nobles didn't want to waste time doing themselves.

Back then, however, you weren't alive. You have insider knowledge on your previous owner or perhaps others who passed through your area. This knowledge may be used for leverage, revenge, or other means, at the discretion of your GM. This knowledge, while it may prove useful in your adventure, may also make you a target for those whose secrets you possess.\r\n\r\n### Background Feat\r\nAs a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|Brawny|\r\n|2|Medic|\r\n|3|Charmer|\r\n|4|Techie|\r\n\r\n|d8|Feat|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|Crafter|\r\n|6|Linguist|\r\n|7|Shard Modification|\r\n|8|Customized Droid|\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nYou have grown to accept and even appreciate the event that freed you from a life of servitude. You are alive, and nobody can convince you otherwise. You fight to prove your worth amongst the living, find your place in society, strive to free others of your kind, and show them the same truth you know now. \r\n\r\n|d8|Personality Trait|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|I strive to be viewed as a peer to living beings.|\r\n|2|I despise those that once called me property.|\r\n|3|I refuse to be controlled anymore, and I will not allow others of my kind to be stuck in said fate.|\r\n|4|I struggle to handle my new emotions, and am prone to sudden emotional outbursts.|\r\n|5|I'm always defensive; sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.|\r\n|6|I feel tremendous sorrow for others like myself who aren't yet free.|\r\n|7|I am horribly, horribly awkward in social situations.|\r\n|8|I'm used to teaching those of lesser intellect, patiently explaining anything and everything to others.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Ideal|\r\n|:---:|:---------|\r\n|1|**Rules.** I feel compelled to follow orders and am opposed to breaking the law for any reason.

I must someday confront them.|\r\n|5|Everything I do is for others of my kind, and the friends I fight alongside.|\r\n|6|I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.|\r\n\r\n|d6|Flaw|\r\n|:---:|:----------|\r\n|1|I have certain rituals that I must follow every day. I can never break them.|\r\n|2|I don't understand emotions and often misread emotional cues.|\r\n|3|I take things literally unless the non-literal meaning is explained to me.|\r\n|4|I always second guess myself, and cannot get over the notion others are superior to me.|\r\n|5|I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble.|\r\n|6|My past deeds haunt me to this day.|\r\n\r\n## Insurgent\r\n\r\nHave enemies? Good, that means you stood for something at some time in your life. For you, that was taking a stand against the status quo back home. Whether it was against scheming merchant lords or an oppressive autocracy, you made your voice heard to push for change...and perhaps its the reason why you're now adventuring, having left your home to gather allies or flee retribution. \r\n___\r\n- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Insight, Persuasion, Stealth, or Technology\r\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's implements, disguise kit, or forgery kit\r\n- **Languages:** One of your choice\r\n- **Equipment:** One set of tools in which you are proficient, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr\r\n\r\n#### Form of Protest\r\nEvery insurgent has a method to their madness when it comes to rebelling against the authorities.

You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.\r\n\r\nYou begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days.

You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.\r\n\r\nYou must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher.

Your casting ability for this at-will power depends on the power list you chose from: Wisdom or Charisma (depending on power alignment) for force powers or Intelligence for tech powers.\r\n\r\n### Combat Caster\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 4th level, the ability to cast force or tech &emsp;powers_\r\nYou've practiced making your powers more difficult to avoid, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:\r\n- When a creature rolls a 1 on the d20 roll of a saving throw against a power you cast that deals damage, they instead take the highest number possible for the damage die.\r\n- You learn one at-will power that requires a saving throw.

You must spend your action each subsequent round on maintaining this concentration, or lose concentration for both powers.                              \r\n- At the end of each of your turns where you have two powers you are concentrating on, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + the number of complete rounds you've been concentrating on two powers). On a failure, you lose concentration for both powers. You can drop concentration on one of your powers during your turn as a free action to avoid this saving throw.\r\n- Any time you would be forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both powers' levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On a failure, you lose concentration on both powers.\r\n\r\n### Mounted Caster\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 4th level, the ability to cast force or tech &emsp;powers_\r\nYou are trained in the use of powers while mounted. While you are mounted and aren't incapacitated, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- When you cast a power targeting yourself, you can also affect your mount with the power.\r\n- You have advantage on melee force or tech attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.\r\n- If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.\r\n\r\n### Quick Caster\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 4th level, the ability to cast force or tech &emsp;powers_\r\nYou've practiced casting powers in quick succession, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:\r\n- When you cast a power with a casting time of a bonus action, you may use your action to cast a power with a power level no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded down).\r\n- When you cast a power with a casting time of a bonus action, you can cast it without expending force or tech points as long as it is no higher level than your proficiency bonus. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Sniping Caster\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 4th level, the ability to cast force or tech &emsp;powers_\r\nYou've practiced casting powers more accurately from long range, learning techniques that give you the following benefits:\r\n- When you cast a power that requires you to make an attack roll, the power's range is doubled.\r\n- Your ranged force and tech attacks ignore one-quarter, half, and three-quarters cover.\r\n- You learn one at-will power that requires an attack roll. Your casting ability for this at-will power depends on the power list you chose from: Wisdom or Charisma (depending on power alignment) for force powers or Intelligence for tech powers.\r\n\r\n### War Caster\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 4th level, the ability to cast force or tech &emsp;powers_\r\nYou've practiced casting powers in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:\r\n- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a power when you take damage.\r\n- Once per round, when a hostile creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a power at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The power must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.\r\n\r\n### Casting Specialist\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 4th level, the ability to cast force or tech &emsp;powers_\r\nChoose one from force- or tech-casting. You've mastered your chosen casting type, gaining the following benefits:\r\n- You gain a +1 bonus to your force or tech save DC and your force or tech attack modifier.\r\n- Once per turn, when you cast a power that requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can have advantage on one attack roll, or you can force one creature affected by the power to have advantage or disadvantage on the saving throw (your choice). Once you've used this feature on a power, you can't affect that power again until you complete a short or long rest. Once you've used this feature on a creature, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n- Once per turn, when you cast a power that doesn't require an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, but requires a die roll, you can choose the maximum or minimum on the die (your choice). If the power requires rolling multiple dice, you can only affect a number of them equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) in this way. Once you've used this feature on a power, you can't affect that power again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\nYou can select this feat twice. Each time you do so, you must choose a different casting type.\r\n\r\n## Ability Capstone Feats\r\nAt higher levels, character tend to reach the pinnacle of an ability score, representing their mastery of that aspect. These feats are designed to give those characters an edge greater than just the ability score.\r\n\r\n### Titan's Power\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 12th level, Strength 20_\r\nYou have the strength that legends tell of, granting the following benefits:\r\n- You gain proficiency in Strength saving throws. If you are already proficient in them, you instead gain expertise in them.\r\n- You ignore the two-handed property of weapons with which you are proficient.\r\n- When you miss with a melee weapon attack, the creature takes damage equal to your Strength modifier.

If you are already proficient in them, you instead gain expertise in them.\r\n- Enhanced effects, such as powers or medpacs, that would restore hit points to you can't restore an amount less than half your level + your Constitution modifier. If this amount would exceed that maximum amount of hit points that effect could restore, you instead take that effect's maximum.\r\n- You can add your Constitution modifier to death saving throws you make.\r\n\r\n### Cunning Intellect\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 12th level, Intelligence 20_\r\nYou have the cunning of the most prolific scholars, granting the following benefits:\r\n- You gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws. If you are already proficient in them, you instead gain expertise in them.\r\n\r\n- When you engage in the Training downtime activity, during resolution, you add your proficiency bonus to the check.

You sense that an effect is trying to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or its true nature. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Overwhelming Presence\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 12th level, Charisma 20_\r\nYou have the presence of the most affluent of leaders, granting the following benefits:\r\n- You gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws.

Once they've done so, they can't do so again until they finish a short or long rest.\r\n- As an action, you can attempt to distract up to five creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). Any creature immune to being charmed is unaffected. If you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, for the next minute, a creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the effect ends or until the target can no longer see or hear you. This ends early if you are incapacitated or die.\r\n\r\n## Companions\r\nA companion is a creature who accompanies you on your adventures. It might take the form of a fearsome beast, a padawan learner, a droid sidekick, or a mischievous spirit. Some companions are an integral part of an archetype, while others are simple NPCs that characters encounter and adopt during their adventures.\r\n\r\n> #### Companions In Your Game\r\n> Companions are not for the faint of heart. They add a significant power boost to a party, and can really bog down your game if their player's are not prepared. You might choose to allow your players to use the companion archetypes, but not the feats, vice versa, both options, or none. It's up to you.\r\n> ***Starting Equipment.*** Companions generally don't start with any equipment, so it's up to the player to gear their companion. For the sake of modesty, humanoid companion should probably start with a set of basic clothing, as appropriate.\r\n> ***Downtime Activities.*** Companions should not be able to perform downtime activities separately from their player's character. However, companions should be able to help others perform their downtime activities. Additionally, a player can choose to have their companion perform a downtime activity, though their character must spend their downtime helping the companion.\r\n> ***Encounter Building and Experience Allocation.*** A companion's level matches that of their owner, so they do not need to gain experience. However, you should consider treating a companion as half a character when building encounters and distributing experience. For instance, if your party is three characters and one companion, you should generate encounters and divide experience gained 3.5 ways, instead of simply three ways.\r\n> ***Enhanced Items.*** Companions should not count towards party size when allocating enhanced items. Additionally, while companion classes share names with their player character class counterparts, companions can not attune to items that require that class.\r\n> ***Starships and Deployments.*** Companions can not deploy as pilots, though they can fill other deployments as normal. Additionally, companions can gain deployment ranks, though they accrue prestige at half the rate of player characters, and they can not exceed 4 ranks in a deployment.\r\n\r\n### Gaining a Companion\r\nCertain archetypes, such as the Astrotech Engineer, Saboteur Operative, or Zoologist Scholar, have their companions as the focus of their archetype's features. Alternatively, a companion can be gained through taking the Companion Keeper feat, detailed later in this chapter.\r\n\r\nRegardless of how a companion is obtained, each player may have no more than one companion at a given time.\r\n\r\n### Generating Your Companion\r\nFirst, you should determine your companion's nature and appearance, as determined by your archetype feature or chosen from the list of companion natures if you take the Companion Keeper feat. Second, allocate your companion's ability scores, as determined by its nature. Finally, you should generate your companion from 1st level using the follower class, and increase its level one level at a time, until its level equals your own. Be sure to update your companion's hit points, ability scores, proficiency bonus, and any features it gains as it levels.\r\n\r\n#### Companion Nature\r\nYour companion's nature, discussed later in this chapter, is determined by your archetype feature or companion feat. Your companion's nature determines its type, its hit points and Hit Dice, its proficiencies and other features, and its companion traits. At 1st level, your companion starts with two traits. It gains additional traits when it reaches higher levels, as shown in the follower table.\r\n\r\n#### Class and Features\r\nYour companion gains features when it reaches certain levels, as shown in the follower table.\r\n\r\n#### Leveling Your Companion\r\nYour companion's level equals your own, and each time you gain a level, so does your companion. \r\n\r\n#### Proficiency Bonus\r\nYour companion's proficiency bonus is equal to that of a player character of the same level, as shown in the follower table.\r\n\r\n> #### Starting Equipment\r\n> Generally speaking, companions are not intended to start with any equipment; it is up to you to outfit them as you deem appropriate. Humanoid companions should probably at least have clothing, however.\r\n\r\n### Companions in Combat\r\nIn combat, companions generally behave as a player character would, with the following differences.\r\n\r\n#### Actions in Combat\r\nUnless you use your bonus action to direct your companion, your companion can only use its action to Dash, Dodge, Disengage, Guard, or Hide.\r\n\r\n#### Companion Initiative\r\nBoth you and your companion roll initiative, but you act together on the lesser of the two results. You act on one turn, and you can each move or take actions in any order.\r\n\r\n## Companion Natures\r\nCertain class features grant a specific companion nature, while the Companion Keeper feat offers your choice of companion nature. You must meet a companion nature's requirement in order to choose that companion. You may only have one active companion at a time.\r\n\r\n> #### Alternative Companion Nature\r\n> Your archetype feature may grant you one type of companion, whereas your character can be better realized utilizing a different companion. For instance, an astrotech engineer might prefer to have a tracker droid over one of the larger droid options. Work with your GM to determine if a different companion is better suited, and mechanically appropriate, to your character's identity. \r\n\r\n&emsp;You may choose your companion's nature from the following options or roll on the table below to determine it randomly. \r\n\r\n|d10|Companion Nature|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Aberrant|\r\n|2|Beast|\r\n|3|Droid|\r\n|4|Humanoid|\r\n\r\n|d10|Companion Nature|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|5|Spirit|\r\n|6|Thrall|\r\n|7|Tracker Droid|\r\n|8|Turret|\r\n\r\nIf you determine your companion's nature randomly, and the result is a nature for which you are ineligible, simply reroll until you get a proper result.\r\n\r\nIf your companion is irreparably destroyed, or you want a different companion, you must first break the bond with your current companion. Bonding with a new companion takes 8 hours spent in an appropriate location. You may only have one companion at a time. If you want to change your companion nature, as with the Alternative Companions feature above.\r\n\r\n#### Aberrant Companion\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Proficient with alchemy kits_\r\n\r\n> Aberrant companions are part of a WIP scholar archetype.\r\n\r\n#### Beast Companion\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Proficiency in Animal Handling_\r\nThrough spending time in the wilderness or discovering a forlorn creature in a foreign environment, you gain the loyalty of a beast companion.\r\n\r\n#### Droid Companion\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Proficiency with astrotech's implements_\r\nThrough creation of your own or capture of another, you gain the services of a droid companion.\r\n\r\n#### Humanoid Companion\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Proficiency in Intimidation or Persuasion_\r\nThrough menacing or recruitment, you gain the fidelity of a humanoid companion.\r\n\r\n#### Spirit Companion\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Discovery of a spirit's essence_\r\nThrough happenstance or misfortune, you gain the curiosity of a spirit companion.\r\n\r\n> Spirits don't exist yet, but they will as a part of the Path of Communion sentinel rework c. 2023.\r\n\r\n#### Thrall Companion\r\n_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force powers_\r\n\r\n> Undead thralls are part of a WIP consular archetype.\r\n\r\n#### Tracker Droid Companion\r\n_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast tech powers_\r\nThrough fabrication of your own or purchase from a vendor, you gain the assistance of a tracker droid companion.\r\n\r\n#### Turret Companion\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Proficiency with artillerist's kit_\r\nThrough construction of your own or coopting someone else's, you gain the use of a turret companion.\r\n\r\n## Beast Companion \r\nYour beast takes a form of your choosing. Alternatively, your GM can choose what form your beast takes based on your environment. Once you've chosen your beast's appearance, you assign your beast companion's ability scores. Your beast's Intelligence score is 6, and you assign its other ability scores using a standard array (16, 14, 12, 10, 8) as you see fit.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Beast Features\r\nAll beasts share the following traits.\r\n\r\n#### Hit Points\r\n___\r\n- **Hit Dice:** 1d4 per beast companion level\r\n- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 4 + your beast's Constitution modifier\r\n- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d4 (or 3) + your beast's Constitution modifier per beast level after 1st\r\n\r\n#### Proficiencies and Features\r\n___\r\n- **Languages:** Your beast can understand simple commands spoken in two languages of your choice, as well as hand signals, but it can not speak\r\n- **Size:** Tiny\r\n- **Speed:** 20 ft.\r\n- **Type:** Beast\r\n- **Armor Class:** Your beast's armor class equals 10 + its Dexterity modifier.\r\n- **Barding:** Your beast requires proficiency in armor in order to have it made into barding for them, and if the your beast's size increases, the barding must be upgraded accordingly.\r\n- **Natural Weapon:** Your beast companion attacks with a natural weapon, such as claws or a bite, with which it is proficient. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage.\r\n- **Attitude:** The beast obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast acts on its own.\r\n\r\n### Bestial Traits\r\nThe traits are presented in alphabetical order. If a trait has prerequisites, your companion must meet them to adopt it. Your companion can adopt a trait at the same time that it meets the trait's prerequisites. Whenever your companion gains a level, it can exchange one trait for another one.\r\n\r\n#### Aerial\r\nYour companion has a flying speed equal to its walking speed, and opportunity attacks made against it have disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Amphibious\r\nYour companion has a swimming speed equal to its walking speed, and it can breathe air and water.\r\n\r\n#### Burrower\r\nYour companion has a burrowing speed equal to its walking speed, and it has blindsight out to 10 feet.\r\n\r\n#### Charger\r\nIf your companion moves at least half its speed straight towards a target before making a melee attack, it deals an additional 1d8 damage on a hit.\r\n\r\n#### Climber\r\nYour companion has a climbing speed equal to its walking speed, and it has advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing.\r\n\r\n#### Closed Mind\r\nYour companion has advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.\r\n\r\n#### Darkvision\r\nYour companion is accustomed to low-light environments.

Instead, if they would scale at 5th level, they instead scale at 11th level, and if they would scale at 11th level, they instead scale at 17th level.\r\n\r\n#### Grappler\r\nWhen your companion hits with a melee weapon attack, it can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target. On a success, the target is both grappled and restrained, and your companion can't attack again while it has a creature grappled.\r\n\r\n#### Heavy Hide\r\nYour companion's armor class becomes 14. \r\n\r\n#### Keen Hearing\r\nYour companion has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.\r\n\r\n#### Keen Sight\r\nYour companion has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\r\n\r\n#### Keen Smell\r\nYour companion has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.\r\n\r\n#### Light Hide\r\nYour companion's armor class becomes 11 + its Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Medium Hide\r\nYour companion's armor class becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2.\r\n\r\n#### Natural Camouflage\r\nWhen your companion attempts to hide, it can opt to not move on its turn.

This die becomes a d6 at 7th level and a d8 at 15th level.\r\n- Your companion can use Dexterity instead of Strength whenever it would make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple, shove, or trip a creature.\r\n- When your companion takes the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a martial artist weapon on your turn, it can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. \r\n- Your companion can take the Dash and Disengage actions as a bonus action.\r\n\r\n### Unarmored Defense\r\nAlso at 3rd level, while your companion is wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, its AC equals 10 + its Dexterity modifier + its Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your companion's choice).\r\n\r\n### Focus\r\nAt 7th level, your companion's training allows it to harness the mystic energy of focus. Its access to this energy is represented by a number of focus points. Your companion has three focus points. It gains an additional focus point at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.\r\n\r\nYour companion can spend these points to fuel various focus features. Your companion knows three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. \r\n\r\n&emsp;When your companion spends a focus point, it is unavailable until your companion finishes a short or long rest, at the end of which it draws all of its expended focus back into itself. Your companion must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain its focus points.\r\n\r\nSome of your companion's focus features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects.

At 18th level, it can instead spend 2 focus points to gain a flying speed equal to its walking speed until the end of your turn, though it falls if it ends its speed in the air and nothing else is holding it aloft.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Strikes\r\nAlso at 7th level, your companion's unarmed strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.\r\n\r\n### Extra Attack\r\nBy 11th level, your companion can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the Attack action on its turn.\r\n\r\n### Evasion\r\nAt 15th level, when your companion is subjected to an effect, such as a consular's *force storm* or an engineer's *explosion*, that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead take no damage if it succeeds on a saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.\r\n\r\n### Diamond Soul\r\nAs of 18th level, your companion gains proficiency in all saving throws. Additionally, whenever your companion fails a saving throw, it can spend 1 focus point to reroll it and take the second result.\r\n\r\n## Operative\r\nIn order to become an operative, your companion must have a Dexterity or Intelligence score of 13 or higher.\r\n\r\nAs an operative, your companion gains the following class features.\r\n\r\n#### Proficiencies\r\n___\r\n- **Armor:** Light armor\r\n- **Weapons:** Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons, blaster pistol, hidden blade, techblade, vibrorapier\r\n- **Tools:** One specialist's kit of your choice\r\n___\r\n- **Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence\r\n- **Skills:** Choose any four\r\n\r\n### Sneak Attack\r\nBeginning when your companion chooses this class at 3rd level, your companion knows how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, it can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature it hits with an attack if it has advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.\r\n\r\nYour companion doesn't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and your companion doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.\r\n\r\nThe amount of extra damage increases to 2d6 at 7th level, 3d6 at 11th level, 4d6 at 15th level, and 5d6 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Cunning Action\r\nAlso at 3rd level, your companion's quick thinking and agility allow it to move and act quickly. Your companion can take a bonus action on each of its turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.\r\n\r\n### Bad Feeling\r\nAt 7th level, your companion has a wary eye, bordering on paranoia.

A creature may only benefit from this feature once. If a creature is targeted by this feature again before using it, they can choose to retain the first benefit or replace it with the new skill or tool instead.\r\n\r\nOnce your companion has used this feature, it must complete a short or long rest before it can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Calm and Collected\r\nAs of 18th level, when your companion makes a saving throw caused by an effect it can see, it may gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to its Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\nOnce your companion has used this feature, it must complete a short or long rest before it can use it again.\r\n\r\n## Scout\r\nIn order to become a scout, your companion must have a Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence score of 13 or higher.\r\n\r\nAs a scout, your companion gains the following class features.\r\n\r\n#### Proficiencies\r\n___\r\n- **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor\r\n- **Weapons:** All blasters, all vibroweapons\r\n- **Tools:** None\r\n___\r\n- **Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity\r\n- **Skills:** Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Perception, Piloting, Stealth, Survival, and Technology\r\n\r\n### Techcasting\r\nBeginning when your companion chooses this class at 3rd level, during its training it has derived powers from schematics with the aid of a wristpad.

For instance, before you can be come proficient with an exotic blaster, you would first need to be proficient in all simple and martial blasters. For modal exotics (discussed below), if the exotic has modes that would fall in two different weapon categories, you require proficiency all simple and martial weapons in both categories in order to gain proficiency in that exotic.\r\n\r\n### Types of Exotic Weapons\r\nExotic weapons come in two major types: modal and specialized.\r\n\r\n#### Modal Exotics\r\nModal exotics have the capacity to switch between modes, with each mode utilizing the damage and properties of an existing weapon, as indicated by the weapons included with the property. Switching between each mode can be achieved by using a character's object interaction on their turn.\r\n\r\n> #### Combination Weapons\r\n> This rule allows characters to combine lightweapons with other lightweapons and vibroweapons with other vibroweapons, granting modes that can be switched between on a character's turn by using their object interaction. Blasters, on the other hand, can gain an attachment that lets them load wrist launcher ammunition in addition to their base ammunition, granting them some limited additional effects.\r\n> Modal exotics instead allow a blaster to have multiple modes that a character can switch between using their object interaction. Modal lightweapons and vibroweapons can grant a mode of a different weapon type, still using that object interaction to switch between. For instance, a modal exotic vibroweapon could have a separate blaster or lightweapon mode, instead of a vibroweapon mode.\r\n> Additionally, modal exotics count as a number of weapons equal to their modes when using the Combination Weapons rule. For instance, an IWS has three modes and thus would count as three weapons. Adding the wrist launcher attachment to it would require a DC 20 ability check, as appropriate, and a proficiency bonus of +4. The attachment would only have a reload property of 1, in this instance, since the total reload number of this attachment combined with the number of weapon modes should not exceed what the total number of combined weapons could be, per the Combination/Separation DC by Weapons table.\r\n\r\n#### Specialized Exotics\r\nSpecialized exotics, on the other hand, bypass the inherent base and cap to a weapon property. For instance, a weapon with the keen 1 property could not bypass keen 3, per the rules of weapon modifications. A specialized exotic, on the other hand, could potentially start with the keen 2 property, and have up to the keen 4 property. A specialized exotic weapon must have that property in order to bypass its base and cap, and a specialized exotic cannot bypass the base and cap of more than one property.\r\n\r\n***Biting.*** A specialized exotic lightweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Bright.*** A specialized exotic lightweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Brutal.*** A specialized exotic weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Corrupting.*** A specialized exotic lightweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Defensive.*** A specialized exotic light- or vibro-weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Dire.*** A specialized exotic weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Disintegrate.*** A specialized exotic blaster with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Keen.*** A specialized exotic weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Neuralizing.*** A specialized exotic vibroweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Piercing.*** A specialized exotic weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Shocking.*** A specialized exotic vibroweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Smart.*** A specialized exotic blaster with this property gains a (+2, 0) bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Sonorous.*** A specialized exotic vibroweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n***Vicious.*** A specialized exotic weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.\r\n\r\n### Generating Exotics\r\nExotics can be generated just like weapons using the weapon calculator, with the following variations.\r\n\r\n#### Modal\r\n___\r\n- **1.** Modal exotics take the highest weight of each its modes, and add half the weight of each of the other modes.\r\n- **2.** Modal exotics combine the value of each of its modes.\r\n\r\n#### Specialized\r\n___\r\n- **1.** Specialized exotics use the framework of a martial weapon of the appropriate category with an appropriate property.\r\n- **2.** Specialized exotics adds the specialized property value and weight a second time.\r\n\r\n### Exotic Weapon Chassis\r\nFor modal exotics, each mode has separate modification slots, with the exception of augments; augments are shared across all weapon modes. Specialized exotics function like non-exotic weapons.\r\n\r\n##### Blasters\r\n|Name&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| &emsp;Cost&nbsp;&nbsp;|Damage&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Weight&nbsp;&nbsp;|Properties| \r\n|:---|---:|:---|-:|:---|\r\n|\t_Exotic Blasters_\t|||||\r\n| &emsp;Bo-rifle\t\t|  1,075 cr&nbsp;&nbsp;|\u2014\t\t| 8.75 lb&nbsp;&nbsp;\t|Modal (blaster rifle and techstaff) |\r\n| &emsp;IWS           |  3,625 cr&nbsp;&nbsp;|\u2014     |23.00 lb&nbsp;&nbsp;  |Modal (blaster rifle, grenade launcher, and sniper rifle)|\r\n| &emsp;Radrifle\t\t\t|  1,575 cr&nbsp;&nbsp;| 1d6 necrotic|14.00 lb&nbsp;&nbsp;|Disintegrate 15, power cell (range 120/480), reload 8, specialized (disintegrate), strength 13, two-handed|\r\n\r\n##### Lightweapons\r\n|Name&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|Cost&nbsp;&nbsp;|Damage&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Weight&nbsp;&nbsp;|Properties&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|\r\n|:---|---:|:---|-:|:---|\r\n|\t_Exotic Lightweapons_\t|||||||\r\n| &emsp;Saberstaff\t\t|  1,375 cr&nbsp;&nbsp;|\u2014\t\t| 6.50 lb&nbsp;&nbsp;\t|Modal (double-saber and tech-staff) |\r\n| &emsp;Sunsaber\t    |  1,875 cr&nbsp;&nbsp;|1d6 fire| 3.00 lb&nbsp;&nbsp;\t|Bright 15, dexterity 11, hidden, specialized (bright), versatile (2d4)|\r\n\r\n##### Vibroweapons\r\n|Name&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|Cost&nbsp;&nbsp;|Damage&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Weight&nbsp;&nbsp;|Properties&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|\r\n|:---|---:|:---|-:|:---|\r\n|\t_Exotic Vibroweapons_\t|||||\r\n| &emsp;Bo-rifle\t\t|  1,075 cr&nbsp;&nbsp;|\u2014\t\t| 8.75 lb&nbsp;&nbsp;\t|Modal (blaster rifle and techstaff) |\r\n| &emsp;Neuronic whip\t|    725 cr&nbsp;&nbsp;|1d4 kinetic\t\t| 4.00 lb&nbsp;&nbsp;\t|Reach, shocking 15, specialized (shocking)|\r\n| &emsp;Saberstaff\t\t|  1,375 cr&nbsp;&nbsp;|\u2014\t\t| 6.50 lb&nbsp;&nbsp;\t|Modal (double-saber and tech-staff) |\r\n\r\n### Weapon Properties\r\nMany weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.\r\n\r\n#### Modal\r\nA weapon with this property can switch between modes. A list of weapons in parentheses appears with the property-the weapons between which an exotic weapon can be switched by using an object interaction.\r\n\r\n#### Specialized\r\nA weapon with this property bypasses the base and cap of certain properties. Another weapon property in parentheses with the property-the weapon property that the exotic bypasses the base and cap for.\r\n\r\n### Special Weapons\r\nWeapons with special rules are described below.\r\n\r\n#### Atlatl\r\nThis specialized gungan club can be used to throw grenades or similar objects at long distances. If you are wielding this weapon, as part of the action to throw a grenade, you can instead throw it using an atlatl you are holding. The grenade can be thrown at a short distance of 30ft and a long distance of 120ft. When throwing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade\u2019s explosion have advantage on the saving throw.  If you lack proficiency in the atlatl, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.\r\n\r\n#### ARC Caster\r\nWhenever you deal damage with this weapon and roll the maximum on the weapon damage die, the creature hit becomes shocked until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Blaster Cannon\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the blaster cannon uses a specialized power generator that allows it to fire continuously for 10 minutes. Replacing a power generator takes an action.\r\n\r\nBefore firing the blaster cannon, you must deploy it using an action unless you meet its strength requirement. Alternatively, if you\u2019re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this action replaces one of them.  While deployed in this way, you treat this weapon\u2019s strength number as two steps less (from 19 to 15), your speed is reduced by half, and you cannot fire this weapon at long range. You can collapse the blaster cannon as an action or bonus action.\r\n\r\n#### Bolas\r\nA Large or smaller creature hit by a bolas is restrained until it is freed. A bolas has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Dexterity check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The bolas has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons. Destroying the bolas frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the bolas\u2019s effects. While a creature is restrained by a bolas, you can make no further attacks with it.\r\n\r\nDue to their unwieldy nature, bolas make ineffective melee weapons. Melee attack rolls made with them are made at disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Bolt-thrower\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the bolt-thrower fires specialized projectiles in the form of bolts.\r\n\r\n#### Cesta\r\nThis specialized gungan staff can be used to throw grenades or similar objects at long distances. If you are wielding this weapon, as part of the action to throw a grenade, you can instead throw it using a cesta you are holding. The grenade can be thrown at a short distance of 60ft and a long distance of 240ft. When throwing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade\u2019s explosion have advantage on the saving throw. If you lack proficiency in the cesta, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.\r\n\r\n#### Compound Bow\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the compound bow fires specialized projectiles in the form of arrows. You can make a ranged weapon attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one arrow. \r\n\r\nDrawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.\r\n\r\n#### Heavy blaster Cannon\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the heavy blaster cannon uses a specialized power generator that allows it to fire continuously for 10 minutes. Replacing a power generator takes an action.\r\n\r\nBefore firing the blaster cannon, you must deploy it using an action unless you meet its strength requirement. Alternatively, if you\u2019re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this action replaces one of them.  While deployed in this way, you treat this weapon\u2019s strength number as two steps less (from 19 to 15), your speed is reduced by half, and you cannot fire this weapon at long range. You can collapse the heavy blaster cannon as an action or bonus action.\r\n\r\n#### Lightning Cannon\r\nWhenever you deal damage with this weapon and roll the maximum on the weapon damage die, the creature hit becomes shocked until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Lightning Rifle\r\nWhenever you deal damage with this weapon and roll the maximum on the weapon damage die, the creature hit becomes shocked until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Mancatcher\r\nWhen you would make a Strength (Athletics) check to attempt to grapple a creature while wielding a weapon with the grappling property, you can instead make a melee weapon attack with it. If the attack hits, the creature becomes grappled by you, and it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier of the same type as the weapon\u2019s damage.\r\n\r\n#### Mortar Launcher\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the mortar launcher fires grenades. If you lack proficiency in the mortar launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total. A mortar launcher cannot fire on targets within its short range and when firing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade\u2019s explosion do not have advantage on the saving throw. Additionally, when you launch a mortar at a target, you can treat the Weapon's point of origin as being 200ft in the air for the purposes of determining line of sight and cover.\r\n\r\nThe mortar launcher requires the use of a tripod, which is included in the price. Over the course of 1 minute, you can deploy or collapse the mortar launcher on the tripod. While deployed, your speed is reduced to 0.\r\n\r\n#### Needler\r\nThe needler includes a specialized compartment for poison. One dose of poison, when installed in this compartment, retains its potency for 1 hour before drying. One dose of poison is effective for the next 10 shots fired by the weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Retrosaber\r\nThe retrosaber is an ancient type of lightweapon that requires a power cell to function. Once four attacks have been made with a retrosaber, a character must replace the power cell using an action or bonus action. You must have one free hand to replace the power cell.\r\n\r\n#### Rocket Rifle\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the rocket rifle fires specialized projectiles in the form of small missiles.\r\n\r\n#### Sentry Gun\r\nBefore firing the sentry gun, you must deploy it using an action unless you meet its strength requirement. Alternatively, if you\u2019re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this action replaces one of them.  While deployed in this way, you treat this weapon\u2019s strength number as two steps less (from 19 to 15), your speed is reduced by half, and you cannot fire this weapon at long range. You can collapse the sentry gun as an action or bonus action.\r\n\r\n#### Shortbow\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the shortbow fires specialized projectiles in the form of arrows. You can make a ranged weapon attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one arrow. \r\n\r\nDrawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.\r\n\r\n#### Torpedo Launcher\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the torpedo launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of torpedoes. Torpedo launchers have advantage on attack rolls against Gargantuan creatures and disadvantage on attack rolls against Large and smaller creatures. Unlike other weapons, the torpedo launcher can only be loaded using an action, and you don\u2019t add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls you make with it.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo launcher requires the use of a tripod, which is included in the price. Over the course of 1 minute, you can deploy or collapse the torpedo launcher on the tripod. While deployed, your speed is reduced to 0.\r\n\r\n#### Tranquilizer Rifle\r\nThe tranquilizer rifle includes a specialized compartment for poison. One dose of poison, when installed in this compartment, retains its potency for 1 hour before drying. One dose of poison is effective for the next 4 shots fired by the weapon. Additionally, creatures reduced to 0 hit points by this weapon are immediately stabilized, unless that damage would instantly kill them.\r\n\r\n#### Vibro-lance\r\nYou have disadvantage when you use a vibrolance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren\u2019t mounted.\r\n\r\n## Adventuring Gear\r\nThis section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.\r\n\r\n### Ammunition\r\n\r\n#### Arrow\r\nArrows are ammunition used in bow weapons. When you would use poison to coat a weapon or slug cartridge you can instead coat an arrow with the poison. Once a poisoned arrow hits a target, it no longer gives a bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Arrow, Combustive  \r\nA combustive arrow is a specialized arrow for use with bow weapons. When the arrow hits another creature, object, or surface it detonates. Each creature within 5ft of the arrows detonation must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage. Once the arrow hits a target, it no longer gives a bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Arrow, Noisemaker \r\nA noisemaker arrow is a specialized arrow for use with bow weapons. When the arrow hits another creature, object, or surface it generates an explosion of sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away. If the target of the attack is a creature, the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 sonic damage and is deafened until the end of its next turn. Once the arrow hits a target, it no longer gives a bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Arrow, Electroshock\r\nAn electroshock arrow is a specialized arrow for use with bow weapons. When you hit a creature with this arrow, the creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d3 ion damage and becomes stunned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn\u2019t stunned. Once the arrow hits a target, it no longer gives a bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Bolt\r\nThis Bolt-thrower ammunition deals 2d6 kinetic damage on a hit. When you would use poison to coat a weapon or slug cartridge you can instead coat a bolt with the poison.\r\n\r\n#### Bolt, Deafening\r\nThis bolt-thrower ammunition deals 2d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Also on a hit, the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d4 sonic damage on a failed save.\r\nAdditionally, on a failed save, a creature is deafened for 1 minute. At the end of an affected creature\u2019s turn, it can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.\r\n\r\n#### Bolt, Electrifying\r\nThis bolt-thrower ammunition deals 2d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Also on a hit, the creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d4 lightning damage on a failed save.\r\nAdditionally, on a failed save, a creature is shocked for 1 minute. At the end of an affected creature\u2019s turn, it can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.\r\n\r\n#### Bolt, Panic\r\nThis bolt-thrower ammunition deals 2d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Also on a hit, the creature must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, taking 2d4 psychic damage on a failed save.\r\nAdditionally, on a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. At the start of an affected creature\u2019s turn, it can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.\r\n\r\n#### Fragmentation Torpedo\r\nThis torpedo launcher ammunition deals 20d4 kinetic damage on a hit. \r\n\r\n#### Plasma Torpedo\r\nThis torpedo launcher ammunition deals 20d4 energy damage on a hit. \r\n\r\n### Explosives\r\n\r\n#### Charge, Fragmentation\r\nA device used to blow holes in larger constructs and structures, a breaching charge creates a devastating explosion focused in a specific direction. Installing a breaching charge takes 1 minute. The charge can be set with a 6-second timer, or detonated remotely using a remote detonator.\r\n\r\nWhen detonated, the breaching charge explodes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 20d4 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If affixed to a creature, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. Objects, structures, and other surfaces have disadvantage on the saving throw. If affixed to the object, structure, or surface, it instead automatically fails this saving throw.\r\n\r\n#### Charge, Plasma\r\nA device used to blow holes in larger constructs and structures, a breaching charge creates a devastating explosion focused in a specific direction. Installing a breaching charge takes 1 minute. The charge can be set with a 6-second timer, or detonated remotely using a remote detonator.\r\n\r\nWhen detonated, the breaching charge explodes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 20d4 energy damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If affixed to a creature, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. Objects, structures, and other surfaces have disadvantage on the saving throw. If affixed to the object, structure, or surface, it instead automatically fails this saving throw.\r\n\r\n### Life Support\r\n\r\n#### Emergency Raft\r\nThis raft comes packed in a 2-foot-long tube. When activated, the raft quickly deploys, expanding to full size in six seconds. The raft is 6 feet long and 3 feet wide, and can hold up to four Medium creatures not exceeding 800 lb. It comes with two collapsible oars with which to row. The raft can be collapsed and restored over the course of 1 minute.\r\n\r\n#### Emergency Rations (One day's)\r\nEmergency rations come in small pill form, provide all the necessary nourishment for one person for one day, and take up roughly one-tenth the space of field rations. \r\n\r\n#### Environmental Suits\r\nEnvironmental suits are heavy duty completely sealed suits that can be worn over other clothing and armor. Each suit is tailored to a certain environment, and has no effect on environments to which it is not tailored. Due to their encompassing and cumbersome nature, while wearing an environmental suit, a creature's speed is reduced by 15. Environmental suits include 8 hours' capacity of oxygen, which can be replenished by an oxygen tank or directly connected to a source of oxygen such as a life support system on a vehicle or starship.\r\n\r\n***Chemical Suit.*** Chemical suits are sealed suits that repel corrosive acids. While wearing a chemical suit, you have resistance to acid damage, and you are immune to the corroded condition.\r\n\r\n***Conductive Suit.*** Conductive suits help prevent electrocution by grounding electrical sources. While wearing a conductive suit, you have resistance to lightning damage, and you are immune to the shocked condition.\r\n\r\n***Dampening Suit.*** Dampening suits modulate sounds that come from outside the suit. While wearing a dampening suit, you have resistance to sonic damage, you are immune to the deafened condition, and you can't have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sound.\r\n\r\n***Diving Suit.*** Diving suits are sealed suits that help regulate body temperature while underwater. While wearing a diving suit, you have resistance to cold damage, and are protected from the hazards associated with high pressure environments.\r\n\r\n***Flame-Proof Suit.*** Flame-proof suits prevent flames from reaching the wearer's body. While wearing a flame-proof suit, you have resistance to fire damage, and you are immune to the ignited condition.\r\n\r\n***Hazard Suit.*** Hazard suits are made to seal the wearer away from noxious gases. While wearing a hazard suit, you have resistance to poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.\r\n\r\n***Mind-Shielding Suit.*** Mind-shielding suits help protect the wearer's mind\u2014and body\u2014from outside influence. While wearing a mind-shielding suit, you have resistance to psychic damage, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid being frightened, and you have advantage on saving throws to avoid having your mind read or affected.\r\n\r\n***Stabilizer Suit.*** Stabilizer suits help to keep the bearer from being battered by powerful forces. While wearing a stabilizer suit, you have resistance to force damage, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being moved.\r\n\r\n***Space Suit.*** Space suits are suits that enabled wearers to survive and operate in the vacuum of space. While wearing a space suit, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and are protected from the hazards associated with low pressure environments.\r\n\r\n#### Oxygen Tank\r\nOxygen tanks include 8 hours' capacity of oxygen. They can be connected to an environmental suit or respirator to feed it directly or replenish any reduced capacity at a rate of one hour's oxygen per ten minutes connected. Only one oxygen tank can be connected at a time.\r\n\r\n### Storage\r\n\r\n#### Bucket\r\nA bucket stores 3 gallons of liquid or 1/2 cubic foot of solids.\r\n\r\n#### Flask\r\nA flask stores 1 pint of liquid.\r\n\r\n#### Hovercart\r\nThis repulsorcraft is designed to efficiently move large amounts of goods. It has a speed of 30 feet and can store 2,000 lb., not exceeding 120 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n#### Jug\r\nA jug stores 1 gallon of liquid.\r\n\r\n#### Pot\r\nA pot stores 1 gallon of liquid.\r\n\r\n#### Sack\r\nA sack stores 30 ounces, not exceeding 1 cubic foot. \r\n\r\n#### Tankard\r\nA tankard stores 1 pint of liquid.\r\n\r\n#### Vial\r\nA vial stores 4 ounces of liquid.\r\n\r\n### Utilities\r\n\r\n#### Fire Extinguisher\r\nAs an action, you can expend a use of the extinguisher to create a 15 foot cone of misty air which lasts for 6 seconds, snuffing out any unenhanced fires within range. Additionally, each creature within range must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the start of their next turn. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this effect. An extinguisher can be used 5 times before it must be replenished at its original cost.\r\n\r\n#### Gravity Generator\r\nGravity generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable, personal artificial gravity source. Activating or deactivating the belt requires a bonus action and, while active, you are able to move as if in a standard gravitational pull. The generator lasts for 10 minutes and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cell.\r\n\r\n### Weapon and Armor Accessories\r\n\r\n#### Ammo Pouch\r\nAn ammo pouch is a small pouch, usually worn around the waist or chest, which holds 20 slug cartridges. When you reload a weapon, you can draw as much ammunition needed from this pouch without using an object interaction to do so. Instead of slug cartridges, you can instead store a power cell which takes up the space of 10 cartridges.\r\n\r\n#### Propulsion Pack\r\nPropulsion packs enhance underwater movement. Activating or deactivating the propulsion pack requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a swimming speed of 30 feet. The propulsion pack lasts for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 10 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.\r\n\r\n#### Quiver\r\nA quiver which can hold up to 20 arrows, 10 bolts, or 10 darts. Drawing an item from the quiver does not require an object interaction.\r\n\r\n#### Repulsor Pack\r\nRepulsor packs are used to slow descent from a high elevation. Activating or deactivating the repulsor pack requires a bonus action and, while active, your rate of descent slow to 60 feet per round, and you ignore the effects of wind of less than moderate speed (no more than 10 mph). The repulsor pack lasts for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 10 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.\r\n\r\n#### Shock Gloves\r\nA shock glove is a type of armored glove that is coated with a webbed lacing. When used for an attack, this webbing carries a charge that deals 1d4 lightning damage to any objects that the glove come in contact with. If you are engaged in combat with the target of the attack, you must make a grapple check instead of an attack roll, using a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).\r\n\r\n##### Adventuring Gear\r\n\r\n|\tItem\t|\tCost\t|\tWeight\t\t|\r\n|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|\t_Ammunition_\t|\t\t|\t\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Arrow                 |1 cr\t| \u2014 |\r\n|\t&emsp;Arrow, Combustive     |100 cr\t| \u2014 |\r\n|\t&emsp;Arrow, Noisemaker     |125 cr\t| \u2014 |\r\n|\t&emsp;Arrow, Electroshock   |150 cr\t| \u2014 |\r\n|\t&emsp;Bolt\t                |10 cr\t| .25 lb |\r\n|\t&emsp;Bolt, Deafening       |140 cr\t| .25 lb |\r\n|\t&emsp;Bolt, Electrifying    |170 cr\t| .25 lb |\r\n|\t&emsp;Bolt, Panic           |200 cr\t| .25 lb |\r\n|\t&emsp;Torpedo, fragmentation\t    |\t 700 cr\t|\t20.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Torpedo, plasma\t            |\t 725 cr\t|\t20.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t_Explosives_\t|\t\t|\t\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Charge, fragmentation         |\t 750 cr\t|\t4.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Charge, plasma                |\t 775 cr\t|\t4.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t_Life Support_\t|\t\t|\t\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Emergency raft     \t        |\t 250 cr\t|\t10.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Emergency rations (one day's) |\t 25 cr\t|\t\u2014\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Chemical suit\t            |  3,000 cr\t|\t15.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Conductive suit\t        |  3,600 cr\t|\t12.50 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Dampening suit\t        |  2,500 cr\t|\t18.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Diving suit\t            |  2,000 cr\t|\t22.50 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Flame-proof suit\t        |  2,250 cr\t|\t20.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Hazard suit\t            |  1,875 cr\t|\t24.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Mind-shielding suit\t    |  4,500 cr\t|\t10.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Space suit\t            |  1,500 cr\t|\t30.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Stabilizer suit\t        |  1,800 cr\t|\t25.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Oyxgen tank    \t        |\t 100 cr\t|\t20.00 lb\t\t|\r\n\r\n|\tItem\t|\tCost\t|\tWeight\t\t|\r\n|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|\t_Storage_\t|\t\t|\t\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Bucket\t                    |\t   2 cr\t|\t2.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Flask\t                        |\t  10 cr\t|\t1.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Hovercart     \t            |\t 2,000 cr\t|\t150 lb\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Jug              \t            |\t   5 cr\t|\t3.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Pot                           |\t  15 cr\t|\t10.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Sack\t                        |\t   5 cr\t|\t.50 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Tankard                       |\t   3 cr\t|\t1.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Vial\t                        |\t  10 cr\t|\t1.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|   _Utilities_ |       |\r\n|\t&emsp;Fire extinguisher     \t    |\t 170 cr\t|\t6.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Gravity generator     \t    |\t 500 cr\t|\t3.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t_Weapon and Armor Accessories_\t    |\t\t|\t\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Ammo Pouch\t        |15 cr\t| 1.00 lb |\r\n|\t&emsp;Propulsion pack               |    400 cr\t    |\t20.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Quiver\t            |10 cr\t| 1.00 lb |\r\n|\t&emsp;Repulsor pack                 |    300 cr\t    |\t10.00 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Shock gloves\t                |\t 500 cr\t    |\t1.00 lb\t\t|\r\n\r\n## Droids\r\nOne common way to spend wealth is to purchase droids. Some droids are built for scouting, while others offer advanced skillsets. Protocol droids help communicate with foreign bodies, and combat droids can help supplement a budding force. The Droids table offers some choices for purchase.\r\n\r\n|Droid Designation|Cost|\r\n|:--|--:|\r\n|3PO Series Protocol Droid|5,500 cr|\r\n|B1-A Battle Droid|1,300 cr|\r\n|B1-X Battle Droid|2,600 cr|\r\n|Destroyer Droid|84,000 cr|\r\n|DUM Series Pit Droid|650 cr|\r\n|ID9 Seeker Droid|150 cr|\r\n|IG-86 Assassin Droid|22,400 cr|\r\n|HK Series Assassin Droid|212,000 cr|\r\n|R2 Series Astromech Droid|2,800 cr|\r\n\r\n## Mounts and Vehicles\r\nMounts and vehicles are the two most common types of on-planet transport. \r\n\r\n### Mounts\r\nA good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity.\r\n\r\nAn animal pulling a cart or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.\r\n\r\nMounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds of *Star Wars*, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase, like aiwhas from Kamino. Acquiring such a mount is often an adventure in-and-of itself.\r\n\r\nMounts are governed by Animal Handling proficiency.\r\n\r\n#### Barding\r\nBarding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight of barding varies based on the size of the creature, as shown in the Tack, Harness, and Drawn Vehicles table.\r\n\r\n#### Saddles\r\nA military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding an exotic mount.\r\n\r\n##### Mounts and Other Animals\r\n|\tItem\t\t\t|\tCost\t| &nbsp;&nbsp;\t|\tSpeed\t|\tCarrying Capacity\t|\r\n|:--|--:|:--:|:--:|--:|\r\n|\tTauntaun\t\t|\t500 cr\t|\t\t\t\t|\t50 ft.\t|\t480.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tKaadu       \t|\t450 cr\t|\t\t\t\t|\t40 ft.\t|\t620.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tRancor  \t\t| 2,000 cr\t|\t\t\t\t|\t40 ft.\t| 3,320.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tSleen        \t|\t500 cr\t|\t\t\t\t|\t40 ft.\t|\t740.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tVaractyl    \t|   750 cr\t|\t\t\t\t|\t60 ft.\t| 2,200.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tBantha\t\t\t| 1,200 cr\t|\t\t\t\t|\t40 ft.\t| 8,000.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tDewback  \t\t|\t900 cr\t|\t\t\t\t|\t50 ft.\t| 1,140.00 lb\t|\r\n\r\n##### Tack, Harness, and Drawn Vehicles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n|\tItem\t\t|\tCost\t|\tWeight\t|\t\t\t\t\r\n|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|\tBarding (Tiny)            \t|\tx 1/3  \t|\tx 1/2\t|\t\r\n|\tBarding\t(Small or Medium)  \t|\tx 1  \t|\tx 1\t    |\t\r\n|\tBarding\t(Large)            \t|\tx 3  \t|\tx 2\t    |\t\r\n|\tBarding\t(Huge)            \t|\tx 9  \t|\tx 4\t    |\t\r\n|\tBarding\t(Gargantuan)       \t|\tx 27  \t|\tx 8\t    |\t\t\t\t\r\n|\tBit and bridle\t        \t|\t 20 cr\t|\t1.00 lb\t|\t\t\r\n|\tCart\t                \t|\t150 cr\t|\t200.00 lb\t|\t\t\t\r\n|\tFeed (per day)\t        \t|\t  1 cr\t|\t10.00 lb\t|\t\t\t\t\r\n|\t_Saddle_\t               \t|\t\t    |\t    \t|\t\t\t\t\r\n|\t&emsp;\tExotic\t|\t600 cr\t|\t40.00 lb\t|\t\t\t\t\r\n|\t&emsp;\tMilitary|\t200 cr\t|\t30.00 lb\t|\t\t\t\t\r\n|\t&emsp;\tPack\t|\t 50 cr\t|\t15.00 lb\t|\t\t\t\t\r\n|\t&emsp;\tRiding\t|\t100 cr\t|\t25.00 lb\t|\t\t\t\t\r\n|\tSaddlebags\t            \t|\t 40 cr \t|\t8.00 lb\t|\t\t\t\r\n|\tStabling (per day)\t\t    |\t  5 cr\t|\t\u2014\t    |\t\t\t\t\r\n|\tWagon\t\t                |\t350 cr\t|\t400.00 lb\t|\t\r\n\r\n### Vehicles\r\nVehicles are more common on civilized planets than animal mounts. Vehicles do not have access to barding and do not require saddles. Vehicles vary greatly based on price, speed, carrying capacity, personnel capacity, and armaments (if any). Below are some base costs for standard types of speeders. Vehicles are governed by Piloting proficiency.\r\n\r\n##### Vehicles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n|\tItem\t    \t|\tCost\t    |\tSpeed\t|\r\n|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|   Airspeeder      |  14,500 cr    |   750 mph |\r\n|   Landspeeder     |  10,000 cr    |   220 mph |\r\n|\tSpeederbike    \t|\t6,000 cr\t|\t300 mph\t|\t",

Until the power ends, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Your speed increases by 10 feet.\r\n- You have resistance to damage from falling.\r\n- Your jumping distance is tripled.\r\n- You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. If you are on a vertical surface when you end your turn and are not using your hands to climb, you immediately fall unless you have some other means of remaining there.\r\n- Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain or squeezing.\r\n- You ignore the effects of slowed levels under 3.\r\n\r\nOnce before the power ends, you can give yourself advantage on one weapon attack roll on your turn. That attack deals an extra 1d10 force damage on a hit. Whether you hit or miss, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of that turn.\r\n\r\n#### Battlemind\r\n_2nd-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Battle Precognition\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\r\n\r\nThrough the Force, you gain a limited form of telepathy that enables you to anticipate the moves of your opponents in combat. While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +2 AC bonus against melee attacks and a +3 AC bonus against ranged attacks.\r\n\r\nThis AC bonus is not applied against attacks from droids, constructs, or creatures with resistance or immunity to psychic damage.\r\n\r\n#### Break\r\n_At-will universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 30 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nYou inflict 10 force damage to an object you can see within range that is not being worn or carried, generating an explosion of sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away. Even if the object is not destroyed, small shards of shrapnel fly at creatures within 5 feet of it. Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d4 kinetic damage. \r\n\r\nThis power\u2019s kinetic damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4), and the power\u2019s force damage also increases by 10 at each of these levels.\r\n\r\n#### Defensive Technique\r\n_At-will light side power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Varies\r\n- **Duration:** 1 round\r\n\r\nAs part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you ward yourself from it through the Force.\r\n\r\nIf the target forces you to make a saving throw before the start of your next turn, the target takes an additional 1d6 psychic damage, and you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to your saving throw. The power then ends.\r\n\r\nThe power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage to the target, and the psychic damage the target takes for forcing you to make a saving throw increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level and 17th level.\r\n\r\n#### Force Current\r\n_1st-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Force Push/Pull\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Self (15-foot cone)\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nWhen you cast this power, you raise your hand and unleash a burst of Force energy. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 force damage and, if it is Large or smaller, is also pushed back 5 feet. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. All Medium or smaller objects that are not worn or carried within the area of effect are also pushed 5 feet.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. For each slot 2 levels higher than 1st, you can add an additional 5 feet to the push.\r\n\r\n#### Force Intuition\r\n_1st-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** 8 hours\r\n\r\nYour senses attune to your environment for the duration, allowing you to see things before they happen, and react even faster than normal. For the duration, you can use your forcecasting ability modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier when you make initiative checks, if the check doesn't already include that modifier. \r\n\r\nIn addition, once during the duration of this power, if you are surprised at the start of combat, rather than being completely unable to act, you can still use a reaction, and take an action on your first turn in combat. This action can be used only to take one of the following actions: Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, or Use an Object.\r\n\r\n#### Greater Kinetite\r\n_5th-level dark side power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Kinetite\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 120 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nA 5-foot diameter sphere of compressed lightning appears in an unoccupied space of your choice and lasts for the duration. Each creature within 5 feet of the sphere when the power is cast must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. \r\n\r\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move the ball of lightning up to 30 feet vertically or horizontally. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d8 kinetic damage (or half as much damage on a success), and the sphere stops moving this turn. A creature takes half as damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power with a force slot of 6th level or higher, both the lightning and kinetic damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.\r\n\r\n#### Greater Pyrokinesis\r\n_4th-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Improved Pyrokinesis\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 120 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nYou create a wall of Force-enhanced fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration. \r\n\r\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 energy damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. \r\n\r\nOne side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this power, deals 5d8 energy damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.\r\n\r\n#### Heighten Senses\r\n_1st-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you would roll initiative\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** 1 round\r\n\r\nThrough the Force, you sense a sudden shift in your environment, and can seize on it with great speed. You gain advantage on your initiative check, and until the end of your first turn in combat, your walking speed increases by 30 feet.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Force Intuition\r\n_2nd-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Force Intuition\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you would roll initiative\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nYou make your initiative check at advantage, and gain a +2 bonus to AC until the power ends. In addition, until the end of your first turn in the combat, your speed increases by 10 feet and you add 1d4 to your attack rolls. This power ends early if you fail a saving throw or are hit by an attack.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Kinetite\r\n_4th-level dark side power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Kinetite\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 150 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nA 20-foot-radius sphere of compressed lightning springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the power\u2019s duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 kinetic damage. The sphere\u2019s space is difficult terrain.\r\n\r\nUntil the power ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged force attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.\r\n\r\nCreatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power with a force slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases for each of its effects by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Pyrokinesis\r\n_2nd-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Pyrokinesis\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 30 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nA line of roaring Force-enhanced flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 energy damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\r\n\r\n#### Instinctive Movement\r\n_1st-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Wall Run\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** 1 minute\r\n\r\nYou enhance your movement with the Force, allowing you to traverse your environment with speed and acrobatic grace. When you cast this power, you gain two speed points. When you cast the power and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can expend a speed point, granting yourself all of the following benefits until the end of that turn:\r\n- Your speed increases by 5 feet. \r\n- You have resistance to falling damage. \r\n- You ignore difficult terrain. \r\n- You have a climb speed equal to your walking speed. \r\n- You add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. \r\n- You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. \r\n- You do not sink when moving over soft or brittle terrain, such as dust, silt, mud, snow, or thin ice. This effect does not allow you to move across liquid surfaces.\r\n- If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with a melee weapon attack for the first time on the same turn, you deal an extra 1d4 damage with that attack.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the turn, the benefits fade entirely until you spend another speed point. If these benefits end while you are still on a vertical surface, or anywhere else where you would normally fall or sink, you immediately fall or begin to sink unless you have some other means to remain there. \r\n\r\nThis power ends when its duration expires, when you cast this power again, or when you have spent all your speed points. When the power ends, any unspent speed points are lost.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st. In addition, if you cast this power with a force slot of 3rd level or higher, you gain one additional speed point for every two slot levels above 1st.\r\n\r\n#### Kinetite\r\n_2nd-level dark side power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Sustained Lightning\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 60 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nA 5-foot-diameter sphere of compressed lightning appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one, and the sphere stops moving this turn.\r\n\r\nWhen you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power with a force slot of 3rd level or higher, both the lightning and kinetic damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.\r\n\r\n#### Land Stride\r\n_1st-level light side power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Self (40-foot radius)\r\n- **Duration:** 8 hours\r\n\r\nYou align yourself with nature, making traversing natural environments far easier. For the duration, your movement and that of creatures of your choice within 40 feet of you can't be slowed by natural terrain, such as mud, rocky ground, vines, or tall grass. Climbing still costs double normal movement. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no traces of its passage.\r\n\r\n#### Master Pyrokinesis\r\n_7th-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Greater Pyrokinesis\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 150 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nA storm made up of sheets of roaring, Force-enhanced flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 energy damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one cube is affected only once.\r\n\r\nThe flame damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.\r\n\r\n#### Phaseshift\r\n_At-will universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nToo quickly for untrained eyes to perceive, you shift in position. You can move up to 5 feet, and this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.\r\n\r\n#### Probe Mind\r\n_2nd-level dark side power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Sense Emotion\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 30 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nFor the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the power and as your action on each turn until the power ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn\u2019t speak any language, the creature is unaffected. \r\n\r\nYou initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature\u2014what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature\u2019s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature\u2019s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it takes 1d6 psychic damage as you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the power ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature\u2019s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your forcecasting ability check; if it succeeds, the power ends.\r\n\r\nOn subsequent turns after probing deeper, you can use your action to deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target automatically.\r\n\r\nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.\r\n\r\nYou can also use this power to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can\u2019t see. When you cast the power or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The power can penetrate barriers. You can\u2019t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn\u2019t speak any language. \r\n\r\nOnce you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can\u2019t see it, but it must still be within range.\r\n\r\nThis power has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial psychic damage a target takes the first time you probe deeper into its mind increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.\r\n\r\n#### Pull Earthward\r\n_2nd-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Force Propel\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 300 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nChoose one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or its flying speed (if any) is reduced to 0 feet for the power\u2019s duration. An airborne creature affected by this power descends at 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground or the power ends.\r\n\r\n#### Pyrokinesis\r\n_At-will universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 60 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nBy stimulating air molecules, you create a zone of Force-enhanced fire on ground that you can see within range. Until the power ends, the enhanced fire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the fire's space when you cast the power must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 energy damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the fire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\r\n\r\nThe fire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.\r\n\r\nThe power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\r\n\r\n#### Reveal Shatterpoint\r\n_5th-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Sense Shatterpoint\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 60 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nYou focus on a creature you can see within range, and gain uncanny insight on its defenses and capabilities through the Force. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you for the duration. On a successful save, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against that creature, and it has disadvantage on its next attack roll against you. Once both attacks have been made, the power ends.\r\n\r\n#### Saber Assault\r\n_1st-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Saber Ward\r\n- **Casting Time:** Special\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** 1 round\r\n\r\nThe first time you take the Attack action during your turn, you can simultaneously cast this power to blend your melee weapon attacks with the use of the Force. For each successful hit you make with a melee weapon before the power ends, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or have a new effect apply until the end of its next turn. Once you've made three weapon attacks, the power ends.\r\n\r\n- **1st Hit:** If the target fails its saving throw, it gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn.\r\n- **2nd Hit:** If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d6 kinetic damage and cannot take reactions until after the end of its next turn.\r\n- **3rd Hit:** If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 2d6 kinetic damage and cannot take bonus actions during its next turn.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage of the second and third hit each increase by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 1st.\r\n\r\n#### Saber Dance\r\n_4th-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Animate Weapon\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nA light- or vibro-weapon of your choice that you are wearing or carrying begins to animate, spinning around your body at high speeds in a 10-foot radius centered on you. For the duration, your movement speed is halved, and the weapon moves with you.\r\n\r\nWhen a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d10 damage of the weapon's type, or half as much damage on a successful saving throw.\r\n\r\nWhen this power ends, you can immediately recall the weapon to your hand.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the power increases to 15 feet, and the power's damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.\r\n\r\n#### Saber Onslaught\r\n_4th-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Saber Strike\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** 1 turn\r\n\r\nYou assume a battle stance. Until the end of your turn, your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

On a hit, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can choose to either knock the target prone, or push it 5 feet away from you.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th level or higher, the bonus weapon damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.\r\n\r\n#### Saber Slash\r\n_3rd-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Saber Strike\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 30 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nYou move in a burst of speed to deliver a deadly blow. When you cast this power, you must be wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, otherwise, the power fails. As part of the action used to cast this power, you move in a straight line to an unoccupied space within the power's range and strike a creature within your weapon's range. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement have disadvantage. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage equal to three rolls of the weapon's damage dice + 4d4 force damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\n***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the force damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.\r\n\r\n#### Sense Shatterpoint\r\n_2nd-level universal power_\r\n___\r\n- **Prerequisite:** Battle Insight\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action\r\n- **Range:** 30 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round\r\n\r\nYou seek deeper insight into the defenses of a creature you can see within range.

Until the power ends, whenever you and the target can see each other, each of you can communicate with the other via telepathy.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to share a language with a creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, and the creature understands you even if it lacks a language. The creature can respond to you telepathically as well, but it must understand at least one language in order to communicate this way.

Typically well-muscled, the abyssin's stooping gait results in a slightly hunched appearance. \r\n\r\nA distinctive trait of the abyssin is their ability to heal quickly; their fast regeneration is believed to have been an adaptation to prevent fluid loss via bleeding on their desert homeworld. All cells in the abyssin body are replaced every 80 hours, and organs which typically were paired in other species appear singularly.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nA primitive tribal society, the abyssin of Byss are known as violent and brutish, and their planet is avoided by most beings in the civilized galaxy. Unstable resources on Byss do not allow for mass population growth or for the stabilization of a central government, economy or trade system. \r\n\r\nExisting simply in nomadic tribes, abyssin groups can interact peacefully with one another, though only if both groups have plentiful water and food supplies. Otherwise, they began a 'Blooding', a brawl that ends only when one tribe's warriors are all killed, captured, or incapacitated. Warriors who survive a Blooding are usually allowed to join the winning tribe once they finish their regeneration. This tradition led to some violent incidents when spacers tried to make first contact and trade with Abyssin tribes with scarce water resources, especially since the abyssin assumed the alien traders could regenerate as quickly as they did. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nThere does not appear to be any distinction between male and female names for abyssin. Abyssin don't use surnames.\r\n\r\n**Names.** Anami, Easym, Myo, Qawohl, Seh-run, Sidie\r\n\r\n### Abyssin Traits\r\nAs an abyssin, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Abyssin reach adulthood at age 30 and can live up to 300 years thanks to their regenerative abilities.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Abyssin's violent and anarchic upbringing cause them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Abyssin stand around 6 feet tall and weigh between 200 and 400 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Rapidly Regenerative.*** You heal quickly, both at will and in response to danger. As a bonus action, you can choose to spend one of your Hit Dice to recover hit points. Additionally, when you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Hit Die to regain hit points as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.\r\n\r\n***Rugged Survivalist.*** You are proficient in the Survival skill. Additionally, you are naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\r\n\r\n***Tech-Impaired.*** While abyssin can figure out basic technology, they experience difficulty using more complex equipment like wristpads. You can not use tech powers or take levels in techcasting classes.\r\n\r\n***Savage Attacks.*** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Abyssin. Abyssin uses mainly growls and grunts that many species consider primitive. The written form of language uses only a small number of simple hieroglyphs.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Advozse\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Green, brown, muddy yellow, or tan|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Black or red|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Large eyes, single horn on head, pointed ears|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'9\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |100 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Riflor|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Advb|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nAdvozsec evolved from herbivorous reptile-analogs which fed on the vegetation known to form around Riflor's hot springs. Evolving into a class of reptomammal, advozsec have a single horn at the crown of their heads, four digits on each hand and foot, pointed ears, and large eyes. Advozsec are strictly vegetarian, unable to properly digest meat. The geothermal hot springs that appear on their homeworld forced the species to evolve thick skin in order to survive. The large eyes of the advozsec are adaptations to the clouds of volcanic ash which darken Riflor's skies. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nSince so much of the sunlight on Riflor is blocked by volcanic eruptions, advozsec tend to settle near geothermal springs for heat. Unfortunately, these springs also tend to be in geologically unstable regions, and anything built near them is often destroyed or abandoned due to eruptions or groundquakes. As a result, the advozse people ended up having little attachment to material goods or long-term plans, and developed a pessimistic, selfish, and even paranoid outlook on life. This facet of their culture remained long after contact with the Galactic Republic gave them access to modern construction techniques allowing for more permanent buildings. Seeing financial stability as the only truly achievable stability one could find in life, the advozsec constantly strive to accumulate as much monetary wealth as they can in a lifetime in order to have the ability to rebuild when the worst happens.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nAdvozsec have simple names that do not distinguish between genders, using familiar surnames.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Dleck, Fjemm, Gorde, Rollar, Xon\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Ghantere, Leventraim, Timack, Vy, Zimda\r\n\r\n### Advozse Traits\r\nAs an advozse, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Advozsec reach adulthood in their late teens and typically live for over half a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Advozsec's paranoid and pessimistic nature causes them to tend towards balanced alignments, particularly lawful balanced, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Advozsec typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 130 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n***Horn.*** Your sharp horn is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Lava Dweller.*** Your body is well accustomed to extreme heat, giving you resistance to fire damage.\r\n\r\n***Vigilant.*** When you would roll initiative, you can choose to have advantage on the roll. Once you've done so, you must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Advb. Advb sounds quick and aggressive. It's incredibly rare to find a non-advozsec speaking Advb, some linguists even considering it all but a dead language. \r\n\r\n___\r\n>  ## Aing-Tii\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |White|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Force-sensitivity, unique technology, six green tongues|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'7\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |145 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Aing-Tii homeworld in the Kathol Rift|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Non-verbal communication  via taste, smell, and touch|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe aing-tii are a species of sentient, toothless mammals who stand on two clawed feet with two spindly arms, each with three large digits. Their bodies are covered in jointed white, bony plates covered in unique painted motifs. The aing-tii head is small and juts out perpendicularly from their chest, featuring two large eyes and six long, thin, green tongues extending from their mouths. They have a long, prehensile tail. The species is incapable of producing sound and conveys information via tasting, smelling and touching each other with their tongues.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe aing-tii are native to a planet whose location in the Kathol Rift is a closely guarded secret. Although in a dangerous area of space, the majority of Aing-Tii never leave their homeworld nor have any contact with the outside world. Those who do\ufffdcommonly called aing-tii warrior monks\ufffdare often xenophobic and reclusive. The monks spend their entire lives performing errands for their gods, in the hope that they will receive \"an answer\" from them. The aing-tii hate slavery, and often attack slavers who roam the Kathol Outback.\r\n\r\nWhile the aing-tii are Force-sensitive, they avoid wielding the Force, which they see as sacred. The aing-tii believe that everything is somehow guided by the Force. They do not believe in the light or dark sides of the Force. Instead, they hold that there are many different aspects to the Force.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nAing-tii names are, in reality, non-verbal and only truly understandable via taste, smell, and touch.  The few aing-tii who have been known to the outside world have used translators to convey an auditory identifier. \r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Ben'Sur, Looshen'Fel, Tadar'Ro\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Kulan'Pa, Laman'So, Te'Nuriel \r\n\r\n### Aing-Tii Traits\r\nAs an aing-tii, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Aing-tii reach adulthood in their late teens and live more than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Aing-tii's foreign nature causes them to be hard to understand. Most aing-tii tend toward neutral light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Aing-tii typically stand 6 to 7 feet tall and generally weigh about 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Armored Plates.*** You have thick armored plates. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n***Closed Mind.*** Aing-tii have a natural attunement for the Force, which makes them resistant to its powers. You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.\r\n\r\n***Force-Sensitive.*** You know the *force push/pull* at-will force power. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting ability for this power.\r\n\r\n***Prehensile Tail.*** You have supreme control over your tail and can use it to manipulate objects as well as your hands.\r\n\r\n***Wisdom of the Elders.*** You are proficient in the Lore skill.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can understand, read, and write Galactic Basic, and the non-verbal communication of the aing-tii. However, you cannot speak or make noise verbally.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Aleena\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Blue, gray, purple, tan|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Blue|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Short stature, scaly skin, crested head|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |2'1\"|+2d4\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |35 lb.|x1 lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Aleen|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Aleena|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nAleena are short, reptilian bipeds with large eyes and wide mouths full of small, sharp teeth. Aleena's bodies are long compared to their short arms and stubby legs. Warm-blooded reptiles, they possess exceptional reflexes as well as a fast metabolism which allow them to convert food into energy very rapidly in order to escape predators on their harsh home planet. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nAleena are social and tend to thrive best in with close-knit teams if not with their own kind. They develop strong loyalties to friends and protect those they care about fiercely. Due to their inborn curiosity, the aleena are stereotypically galactic travelers, tourists in every sense. This, combined with their strong dedication to their relatives, results in aleena families traveling even to most unusual and dangerous locations just to see its sights. The appearance of aleena family walking through an intergalactic metropolis is a common sight on many planets. The aleena's love of sports and particularly, adventure and thrill sports, draw many into the galactic community. Most who enter professional classes are experts or diplomats. \r\n\r\nAleena settlements were small, and most individuals were part of a single lineage, or tahiko. The leader of each tahiko led the community, and represented their wishes to the planetary advisory body. The advisory body elected a king to govern the planet, and was generally revered as a religious figure as they led religious ceremonies. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nAleena names are generally short and guttural, with longer names being saved for royalty. Surnames are based on their tahiko, or tribal lineage.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Batts, Gratz, Wakka, Zakan, Zetts\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Arkei, Harza, Sutci, Tsuon, Yenn, \r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Anares, Kylar, Ors, Practes, Targae\r\n\r\n### Aleena Traits\r\nAs an aleena, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Aleena reach adulthood in their late teens and live to be about 80.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Aleena's benevolent yet curious nature causes them to tend toward chaotic light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Aleena typically stand 2 and a half to 3 feet tall and generally weigh about 35 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Bite.*** Your sharp teeth are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage. Lastly, as a bonus action, you can perform a special bite attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Cosmopolitan.*** You have proficiency in Lore.\r\n\r\n***Nimble Escape.*** You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.\r\n\r\n***Nimbleness.*** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.\r\n\r\n***Racer's Reflexes.*** Whenever you make a Dexterity ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to add 1d4 to the result. You can choose to do this after the check is rolled, but before the DM determines if you've passed or failed the check. You cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields. Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Aleena. Aleena is characterized by its use of short syllables and energetic movements to convey urgency and emotion.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Anomid\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Translucent violet to light purple|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Black, gray, or white|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Opalescent; yellow or blue|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |No vocal cords, six-fingered hands|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'8\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |100 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Yablari|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Anomid Sign Language|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nAnomid are a species of humanoids with translucent, purple-hued skin that is smooth but wrinkles with age. They have large, slender hands with six fingers on each: two end fingers, two center fingers and two thumbs, with a sharp claw on each. The fingers are paired in twos and slightly spaced apart from the others. The eyes of the anomids are solid, with no visible irises or pupils and have been seen in varying shades of yellow or blue. The anomids have pointed, fin-like ears that protrude from the sides of their heads. Anomid hair is often long and well kept, and is always found in shades of black, gray or white.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nAnomids almost always wear elaborate masks which cover most of their faces. These are not breath masks, but vocalizer units. Since anomids have no vocal cords, they rely on these vocalizer masks to communicate with other species. These masks are often elaborately customized to reflect an anomid's social status, family origin, or profession. Among themselves, anomids communicate using an elaborate sign language. Anomid sign language requires six-fingered hands, which makes it difficult for humans or human-programmed protocol droids to use.\r\n\r\nAnomid civilization has a long history of pacifism and technical achievement. In fact, most Anomids are pacifists\ufffdhistorians believed that no major wars have ever been fought in the Yablari system.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nAnomid names are usually one or two syllables long, featuring hard consonants. Female names are often softer, with a greater flow to them. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Arkis, Jarak, Magris, Vell \r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Apharis, Eralie, Siphanie, Ulaniye \r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Dekan, Krest, Narroc, Quill, Wode\r\n\r\n### Anomid Traits\r\nAs an anomid, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Anomid reach adulthood in their late teens and live a little under a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Anomid's pacifistic culture causes them to tend toward light alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Anomid typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 120 lbs.

Originating from a world with higher-than-average gravity, the anx possess a stooped stature. Their heads are tall and blade-shaped, with a soaring crest which acts as a sinus cavity. While their crests change color to reflect their moods, its primary function gives anx a low rumbling voice. An anx's large, muscular tail serves as a counterbalance for running.\r\n\r\nAnx have long necks and limbs, and would appear taller if they didn't walk with their shoulders stooped and their crested heads held out in front of them.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe anx are serene giants who assume many roles in the Republic. Evolving from herd animals, the anx are a placid, sociable race known for developing a near fanatical interest in groups they related to. Living in complicated clan structures, anx enjoy the company of their large families and are more comfortable in groups. \r\n\r\nAn innate trait among the anx is a formidable knowledge of anatomy, especially in regard to nerves, muscles and bone structures. Due to this extensive knowledge, even by species they have never encountered, the anx are considered dangerous unarmed combatants and skilled warriors, capable of incapacitating opponents with a single, well-placed strike.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nAnx names are less harsh-sounding compared to those of other reptilian species. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Drexol, Graxol, Horox, Theen\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Kendiula, Madurrin, Pipalidi, Quiyya\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Fida, Jur, Kelvyyn, Ryyd\r\n\r\n### Anx Traits\r\nAs an anx, you have the following special traits:\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Anx reach adulthood in their late teens and live up to 120 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** The anx's social nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Anx stand at around 8 feet tall and weigh about 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Acute Smell.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check involving smell, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.\r\n\r\n***Anatomical Knowledge.*** You have proficiency in the Medicine skill.\r\n\r\n***Subsonic Bellow.*** As an action, you can violently expel air in a 15-foot cone. When you do so, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). A creature takes 2d6 sonic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 4d6 at 5th level, 6d6 at 11th level, and 8d6 at 17th level. This ability has no effect on constructs. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n***Surgical Strikes.*** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can perform a special pressure point attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack\ufffds normal effects, and it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn, and you can\ufffdt use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Anx. Anx is mostly characterized by low, rumbling noises made by the throat, amplified by an anx's crest. Anx are able to communicate over long distances with each other by using loud low-frequency sounds. \r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Anzellan\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Brown, green, or tan|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Black, gray, or white |\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  | Diminutive size, wispy eyebrows|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  | 1'0\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  | 3 lb.|x1 lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Anzella|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Anzellan|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe anzellans are a diminutive species hailing from the secluded planet Anzella. Their eyes have floating corneal micro-lenses that allow them to see microscopic details. Anzellans are a bubbly and receptive people. They are a jovial and trusting people that tend to welcome strangers with open arms.\r\n\r\nDue to their volcanic homeworld, anzellans are also adapted towards heat. This, coupled with their small size, make them well-suited to working in compact places.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nAnzella is a tropical planet covered in thousands of small volcanic islands. Many of these islands are developed as small villages, with the largest islands designed to accommodate larger species. Anzellan culture is generally based around tourism and crafting; in fact, anzellans are renowned craftsmen due to their discerning eyesight and ability to fit into small spaces.\r\n\r\nAnzellan government is generally casual. Each village has its own governing council of rotating members; these villages act independently from one another unless their decisions would affect more than a single island. In that case, all of the councils work together to come to a planet-wide decision. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nAnzellan names are rarely longer than two syllables, with a bouncy intonation to them. Their surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Babu, Gridel, Moru, Rano, Yodel\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Dibi, Fing, Nooni, Teena, Zazi\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** E'ayoo, Frik, Meer, Tanni, Vrut\r\n\r\n### Anzellan Traits\r\nAs an anzellan, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Anzellans are considered adults at ten years old. They are a short-lived species, however, that rarely lives longer than 60 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Anzellans are a friendly and respectful people, which causes them to tend toward lawful light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Anzellans stand between 1 and 2 feet tall and weigh around 10 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Tiny.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 20 feet.\r\n\r\n***Crafters.*** You have proficiency in one tool of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Detail Oriented.*** You are practiced at scouring for details. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight within 5 feet.\r\n\r\n***Pintsized.*** Your tiny stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use medium or heavy shields. Additionally, you can't wield weapons with the two-handed or versatile property, and you can only wield one-handed weapons in two hands unless they have the light property.\r\n\r\n***Puny.*** Anzellans are too small to pack much of a punch. You have disadvantage on Strength saving throws, and when determining your bonus to attack and damage rolls for weapon attacks using Strength, you can't add more than +3.\r\n\r\n***Small and Nimble.*** You are too small and fast to effectively target. You have a +1 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.\r\n\r\n***Tanned.*** You are naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\r\n\r\n***Technician.*** You are proficient in the Technology skill.\r\n\r\n***Tinker.*** You have proficiency with tinker's implements. You can use these and spend 1 hour and 100 cr worth of materials to construct a Tiny Device (AC 5, 1 hp). You can take the Use an Object action to have your device cause one of the following effects: create a small explosion, create a repeating loud noise for 1 minute, create smoke for 1 minute, create a soothing melody for 1 minute. You can maintain a number of these devices up to your proficiency bonus at once, and a device stops functioning after 24 hours away from you. You can dismantle the device to reclaim the materials used to create it.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Anzellan. Anzellan is characterized by its bouncy sound and emphasis on alternating syllables.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Aqualish\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Black, blue, green, or red|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Black, brown, or gray|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Black, blue, red, or brown|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Tusks, belligerent personalities, brawny stature|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|5'5\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|140 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Ando|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Aqualish|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nAn amphibious species native to the planet Ando, the Aqualish people have two facial tusks which curve down over their mouths; a trait which added to their appearance as arachnids. These facial tusks are highly sensitive to heat and cold and are used for cracking open the hard shells of shellfish or burrowing through the swampy loam of their homeworld. Having finned hands and two bulbous black eyes, Aqualish are unable to manipulate most machinery or equipment developed by the galaxy's many species which designed these tools for beings with digits. As a result, Aqualish tend to remain on their homeworld. Aqualish are well known for their hair-trigger tempers that flare without reason.\r\n\r\nWhile Force-sensitive Aqualish are rare, members of the species have trained as both Sith and Jedi, though they typically gravitate toward the former.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe Aqualish hate the image they have in the galaxy as thugs, regardless of its veracity, and blame it on any- and everyone else. Because of this, the species are considered pariahs on Ando, which has a lower population of Aqualish than the galaxy itself. All Aqualish speak mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. Quarrelsome and thug-like, the Aqualish culture revolved around aggression and toughness, with diplomacy being one of their weakest attributes.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nAqualish names are intended to sound strong. Surnames are not familial, but are chosen by each individual Aqualish.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Bung, Gu, Opege, Soni, Tubop\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Cestirki, Duni, Iftu, Sifre, Umi\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Dogomurra, Julo, Kronem, Nidoal, Utix\r\n\r\n### Aqualish Traits\r\nAs an Aqualish, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Aqualish reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Aqualish' aggressive personalities cause them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Aqualish stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 190 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Arms Dealers.*** Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check related to buying or selling weapons, you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.\r\n\r\n***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Menacing.*** You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.\r\n\r\n***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Aqualish. Aqualish is a harsh, guttural language. It's rare that other species bother to learn it unless they regularly interact with Aqualish.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Arcona\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Ebony to mahogany|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Green, blue, pink, gold when addicted|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Flat  heads, easily addicted|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'0\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |95 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Cona|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Arconese|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nArcona have anvil-shaped heads, claws, marble-like eyes, and protective skin. Cona is always hot, and has very little water, but the atmosphere is filled with ammonia vapor. Arcona adapted to this environment by eating the ammonia-converting roots of flora as a source of water. Arcona depended on the ammonia to live and, as a result, arcona living offworld have to take ammonia supplements. Despite their large eyes, arcona have very poor eyesight. Their eyes, made up of thousands of photoreceptors, can not detect fine shapes, only seeing blurry objects. To aid this, they have a small sensory organ between their eyes. Often mistaken for their nose, this organ detects heat patterns from living beings. Thus, arcona can recognize things by its heat pattern.\r\n\r\nArcona are highly susceptible to addiction to spice and common salt, which serves as a hallucinogen with effects resembling that of intoxication. Their eyes shift to gold after prolonged addiction.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nArcona normally think of themselves not as individuals but as a collective whole. Largely forsaking individuality, they often refer to themselves as \"we\" even when alone. The arcona live in loose, family-based communities called nests, which are ruled by a Grand Nest. Because arcona are born in nests underground, they obtain a close sense of family living in close quarters with siblings. Males raise the young, since females are typically impulsive thrill-seekers. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nArcona names are quite diverse, named by their fathers in the nest. Surnames are either familial or nest-based. \r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Bijrik, El, Jat, Kazat, Onalol, Shle\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Ak, Cimam, Cuten, He, Madan, Omik\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Cheen, -drell, -faxel, Shran, Takonak, -voll\r\n\r\n### Arcona Traits\r\nAs an arcona, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Arcona reach adulthood in their late teens and live for more than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Arcona tend toward no particular alignment. They can vary from the chaotic thrillseekers to the orderly lawkeepers. The best and worst are found among them.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Arcona typically stand 5 and a half to 6 and a half feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Claws.*** Your sharp talons are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Clever.*** You have proficiency in one Intelligence skill of your choice. \r\n\r\n***Easily Addicted.*** Arcona are susceptible to spice addiction, and as a result you are taught to identify it from an early age. Additionally, consuming salt can cause them to hallucinate, potentially replicating the effects of spice. Whenever you make an ability check related to identifying salt or spice or seeing whether something contains salt or spice, you have advantage. \r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\r\n\r\n***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve smell.\r\n\r\n***Reptilian Senses.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check related to sensing heat, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Arconese. Arconese is spoken through complex, guttural squeaks from the back of the throat. However, arcona born and raised in colonies outside of Cona often did not learn Arconese, but the local language instead. \r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Ardennian\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Brown or black|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Brown to gray|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Brown or black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Four arms, fur-covered, prehensile feet|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|3'2\"|+2d8\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|50 lb.|x1 lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Ardennia|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Adrennian|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nArdennians are sentient humanoid simians hailing from the tropical paradise of Ardennia. They are covered in fur from head to their wrists and ankles, with brown and grey being the most common fur colors. Ardennians sport four arms and prehensile feet. All six of their limbs are equally dexterous.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe Ardennian people themselves are a friendly communal species that are well known for welcoming visitors and inviting newcomers to traditional feasts and dances on the sandy beaches of Ardennia. Rural Ardiennan's live in modern tree-villages in the thick, dim jungle canopy on the majority of the islands. Ground level accommodations are available for off world visitors even in the smaller villages. Most off-worlders stay in the large modern resort complexes which boast having miles of private beaches or in the modern cities. Several large cities exist, scattered around the world, which typically encompass an entire island or a series of smaller islands joined together.\r\n\r\nArdennia's distance from the main hyperlanes makes it one of the lesser-known vacation destinations, but it's a popular one for those who don't mind the extra travel time. Some affluent visitors prefer the solitude that Ardennia offers, and occasionally end up purchasing one of the smaller islands to build their own home. Ardennia is notable for having the most beach per square meter in the galaxy. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nArdennian's names are typically concise and rarely more than two syllables, with a familal surname.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Rio, Jakar, Hul, Lup, Quil, Jerno\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Rac, Bras, Nuc, Kua, Karta, Sanya\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Betal, Durant, Jabut, Karon, Rambuan\r\n\r\n### Ardennian Traits\r\nAs an Ardennian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Ardennians reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Ardennians' peaceful nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Ardennians typically stand 4 to 4 and a half feet tall and weigh around 60 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Four-Armed.*** Ardennians have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).\r\n\r\n***Jungle Dweller.*** Growing up in the tree-villages of Ardennia has left an impact. You don't treat jungle terrain as difficult terrain.\r\n\r\n***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.\r\n\r\n***Prehensile Feet.*** You have supreme control over your feet and can use them to manipulate objects as well as your hands.\r\n\r\n***Strong-Legged.*** When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier.\r\n\r\n***Treeclimber.*** You have a climbing speed of 25 feet. You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Ardennian.

This proved helpful on their dark and frigid homeworld, but when traveling offworld, many must wear blinders on planets with hotter, younger suns. It is not unheard of for arkanians to undergo genetic or cybernetic manipulation of their own bodies, enhancing themselves so as to be better than \"lesser\" species.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nArkanians are notoriously arrogant, a trait which came from generations of producing some of the galaxy's greatest advancements in genetics and technology. Their homeworld, Arkania, has vast quantities of precious gems; thus, the arkanians have never wanted for much in trade. This wealth went into funding their ambitious scientific projects, the most elaborate of which take generations to be completed. \r\n\r\nMany arkanians have come to see their species as the pinnacle of evolution, and amongst the most\ufffdif not *the* most\ufffdintelligent beings in the galaxy. Those species that are not already put off by their aloof nature often fear them, as tales of \"mad scientists\" and horrific experiments tend to surround them.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nArkanian names are simultaneously dignified and succinct. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Arkoh, Hyrim, Zeta, Suprin \r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Shenna, Elizie, Cratala, Hanna \r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Focela, Barzane, Nasdra, Athacorr\r\n\r\n### Arkanian Traits\r\nAs an arkanian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Arkanians reach adulthood in their late teens and live about 100 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Due to their arrogance and unscrupulous experimentation, arkanians tend towards lawful dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Arkanians typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs.

You can choose to do this after the check is rolled, but before the DM determines if you've passed or failed the check. You cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Crafters.*** You have proficiency in one tool of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark.

The most striking difference between balosars and humanity is a pair of antennapalps which sprouts from underneath the thick, coarse hair on their skulls. Retractable, these atennapalps allow them to listen into the subsonic range and give the species physical intuition and preternatural reflexes, which members of the Jedi Order sometimes mistook for Force-sensitivity. Balosars also possess an acute tolerance for poisonous substances, a byproduct of life on their toxic homeworld.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nEarly in its history, the balosar homeworld was overrun by galactic megacorporations eager to exploit the world's lax ecological protection laws. The planet was home to the balo mushroom, a key ingredient in death sticks, one of the galaxy's most infamous narcotics. After its discovery, Balosar was wrought with corruption, addiction, and pollution from the production and usage of death sticks.\r\n\r\nSince there is little opportunity to flourish on their homeworld, balosars often leave in search of fortune elsewhere. Their natural resistance to the lethal\ufffdbut not the addictive\ufffdeffects of the drug encourages some to enter the death stick business.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nBalosar names have a slight exotic tinge to them\ufffdoften because Balosar parents name their children while on a death stick high. Their surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Barin, Elan, Fantes, Zerba \r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Delaana, Ferrika, Reki, Vetyl \r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Cher'dak, Mer'darro, Sel'Sabagno\r\n\r\n### Balosar Traits\r\nAs a balosar, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Balosars reach adulthood in their late teens and live about 70 years naturally, though death stick addiction has lead to a general decline in their lifespan.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Balosars are notoriously cynical, selfish, and pragmatic, causing most to be neutral dark side. However, there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Balosar stand at an average height of about 5 feet, and weigh about 115 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Keen Hearing.*** Your antennapalps give you advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks based on hearing.\r\n\r\n***Snap Senses.*** Through your antennapalps, you can sense incoming danger and react accordingly. When you roll for initiative, you can choose to gain advantage on the roll. Alternatively, if you are surprised, you may act normally on your first turn. Once you've used this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Spicer.*** You are proficient in spicer's kit.\r\n\r\n***Toxin Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Balosur.

Evolved from nocturnal lizards, the Barabel adapted a thick layer of fat which allowed them to remain active and not sluggish when temperatures dropped. A blaster set on stun would not damage them at all or slow them down, as it would merely bounce off their scales. Barabel are able to shed their tails if necessary, an ability that proved the undoing of many startled foes. They also possess heavy retractable claws along with needle sharp teeth which can grow to be 2 inches in length. A carnivorous species, Barabel possess two stomachs in order to process the massive amount of food they required to survive.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nLiving in low tech communities ranging from a few dozen individuals to no more than ten thousand, the Barabel community is built around a warren where the group thrives and hunted from. The Barabel species is noted for its hunting and tracking prowess; many of their actions are fueled by their hunting instincts, leading to the general feeling that Barabel are always angry. They are well known for their aggression but are also extremely loyal. They also have a great deal of respect for the Jedi because of their first experiences with a Jedi Master who settled a dangerous clan dispute. Apologies, whether for a misdeed or in sympathy, are an unknown concept to Barabel and are considered insulting.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nBarabel names are harsh and gutteral. Female names are often softer. Surnames are warren-based.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Anidroks, Bridiz, Trurzuk, Vilzinok\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Alge, Bulzo, Ekthamo, Inako, Nolku\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Akken, Dutarca, Khigta, Srabulgid, Zhomo\r\n\r\n### Barabel Traits\r\nAs a barabel, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Barabel reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Barabel aggression causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Barabel typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh about 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\r\n\r\n***Hunter.*** You are proficient in Survival. \r\n\r\n***Prehensile Tail.*** You have supreme control over your tail and can use it to manipulate objects as well as your hands.\r\n\r\n***Tooth and Nail.*** Your sharp teeth and claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage. Lastly, as a bonus action, you can perform a special claw attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Barabel. The Barabel language is characterized by its barks and hisses.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Baragwin\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Drag green to dark olive|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Yellow or red|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Hunchback, large heads, strong sense of smell|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'9\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |145 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Old Barag|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Baragwinian|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nA hunchbacked species of sentient reptilians, the bipedal baragwin are easily recognized across the galaxy. Noted for their thick, wrinkled skin which can resist most physical attacks and their shuffling gait, the large-headed race have no obvious differences between male and female baragwin. An acute sense of smell give the species enough sensitivity to detect another being's mood and feelings. This leads some of them into careers as big-game hunters, or even as bounty hunters. Due to their ponderous movement, many non-baragwin believe the race to be a dull-witted people while, in fact, they are quite intelligent. Despite this fact, the baragwin frequently keep this intelligence hidden, using the misconceptions of others to their own advantage.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nBaragwin culture, since it does not derive from a single homeworld, is highly dependent on a baragwin's planet of origin, with Tatooinian baragwin behaving quite differently from those from Denuhi-Eight. Baragwin generally have little prejudice, treating all other beings equally regardless of species, culture, or planetary origins; though criminal baragwin will exploit all beings equally instead. Baragwin settlements are generally small and anarchic, with short-term leaders selected by informal democratic processes. Baragwin are famous as skilled weapon-smiths and introduced many different weapons to different worlds. Baragwin-made blasters and vibroblades are among the most powerful personal weapons in the galaxy. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nBaragwin have names with wide tones, spoken using the entire mouth, that don't differentiate by gender. Baragwin use familial surnames.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Dagel, Eskaul, Idalli, Migo\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Fadani, Igara, Kodrue, Wylbas\r\n\r\n### Baragwin Traits\r\nAs a baragwin, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Baragwin reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Baragwin tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them. \r\n\r\n***Size.*** Baragwin typically stand 5 to 7 feet tall and generally weigh about 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Arms Dealers.*** Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check related to buying or selling weapons, you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. \r\n\r\n***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve smell.\r\n\r\n***Natural Empathy.*** Baragwin's powerful sense of smell allows them to sense the emotions in those around them. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine emotions against humanoids and beasts within 10 feet of you.\r\n\r\n***Travelers.*** You have proficiency in the Survival skill.\r\n\r\n***Weapon Developers.*** Baragwin are famous throughout the galaxy for their quality arms manufacturing. You have proficiency with armstech's implements, munitions kits, or two weapons of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Baragwinian. Baragwinian is a deep language with low rumbling vocalizations. The baragwin themselves, however, are not especially fond of this language. Most of them learn the languages used on whatever planet they were born, so Baragwinian is not very common. Baragwinian is still considered useful as a trade language, however.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Besalisk\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Brown or green|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Yellow|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Bony headcrest, four arms, inflatable wattle|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|6'0\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|175 lb.|x(2d6) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Ojom|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Besalisk|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nMale Besalisks' heads sported prominent crests and four arms hung at their sides; females of the species could have as many as eight arms, but like Humans had a primary hand and a limited range of functionality with the others. The addition of the extra appendages required a hearty metabolism, and these bulky beings were able to store food and water for many days, and if the need arose, they could survive for long periods without either. Scruffy sensory whiskers lined the area below their noses, just above the robust wattle most adult Besalisks possessed.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nBecause of Ojom's harsh environment, large cities were never developed on the world; instead small communes of about a thousand families claim territories around the world and are each led by an elected leader. The communes have a strict policy of keeping the size of their groupings equal to avoid conflict. When too many families grow in one area, the leader would ask certain families to break away and start a new community on another glacier.\r\n\r\nWhile not involved in galactic politics and because they do not produce any of their own technology, the Besalisks established large orbital space stations where offworlders could come to do business. Trading and making deals, any violence on these stations is committed by offworlders as Besalisks avoid confrontation.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nBesalisk name's are generally words that embody them, with a surname attached to their commune.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Darius, Dexter, Plun, Pong\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Delia, Mora, Ren, Teen\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Jettster, Kil, Krell, Ugg\r\n\r\n### Besalisk Traits\r\nAs a Besalisk, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Besalisks reach adulthood in their early teens and generally live to be about 70.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Besalisks tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Besalisks tower over almost all other species, with the smallest standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 200 lbs., and the largest approaching 8 feet tall and 400 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Four-Armed.*** Besalisks have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).\r\n\r\n***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.\r\n\r\n***Powerful Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Besalisk.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Caamasi\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Pink and gray|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Brown, gray, white, or gold|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Yellow or red|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Snouts, memnii, distinct scent|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'9\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |115 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Caamas|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Caamasi|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nA species of furry mammalians, the caamasi are covered in dense fur and have a spicy, woody body scent that is similar to that of Corellian whiskey. They have long arms with three-fingered hands, and pointed ears which stick out from the sides of their heads. They also have extremely acute senses of smell, with their nose positioned at the end of a tooth-filled snout. Caamasi have the interesting ability to share vivid memories called memnii with their near relatives and Force-sensitives. A memnis is as vivid to one who receives it as it was to the one who participated in the event remembered. Their peace-loving natures are in part due to memnii, as having a memory of killing or harming will be particularly strong, becoming unbearable in time, and something caamasi will seek to avoid except in defense of themselves or others, for which case they would accept their burden.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nA pacifist race, culture on Caamas evolved around the basic tenets of peace and social justice; influencing the evolution of the Jedi Order. Working as explorers, diplomats, and artists, the caamasi are a monogamous people who value single partners while mating and starting a family. However following the devastation of their homeworld by the Empire, caamasi who were off-world at the time considered evolving to a position of polygamy so as to regrow the population. While the argument is one of survival, many sociologists familiar with the culture of the caamasi believe that they will not accept the idea.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nCaamasi surnames are often composed of two parts, with the second part designating clan membership.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Althanic, Gelerit, Ryg'gos, Shren\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Eeshraq, Heshrisa, Nulana, Yr'na\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** A'kriy, I'tela, O'Tul, Sho'cyl\r\n\r\n### Caamasi Traits\r\nAs a caamasi, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Caamasi reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Caamasi's peaceful and just nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Caamasi typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 170 lbs.

On a failed save the target is stunned, and you can share vivid memories with the target as if they were their own for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a power). The transfer ends if you stop touching the target. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw to resist the transfer. On a success, the transfer ends. Otherwise, you may end the transfer on your turn (no action required). Once you've used this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. This feature has no effect on droids, constructs, or Force-Insensitive creatures.\r\n\r\n***Scholarly.*** You have proficiency in the Insight skill.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Caamasi. Caamasi uses smooth tones and low volumes, making it soothing to listen to.

Chadra-Fan also have involuntary pheromones that conveyed information about their family line and created an aura of attractiveness. Other voluntary pheromones often conveyed a Chadra-Fan's state of emotion-anger, fear, or joy. Chadra-Fan even create more complex messages using their pheromones, though the pheromones when mixed sometimes caused confusion. They are unique in the fact that they had clear blood.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe society of Chadra-Fan is divided into a clan structure in which every member is responsible for parenting the clan's children; a fact of life is that every household is open at any time. Leadership within the clan is a temporary role that is passed from one individual to another as the situation calls for a particular expertise. Children are the centerpiece of a Chadra-Fan community, and only leave when wed. However the new Chadra-Fan couple remain with the smaller clan so it was possible that a Chadra-Fan never leaves his or her home.\r\n\r\nChadra-Fan left by themselves suffer depression, so they regularly seek the company of others; thus, Chadra-Fan are not very picky when it came to friends and prefer complete strangers to loneliness\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nChadra-Fan names do not vary significantly based on sex.

You can use these and spend 1 hour and 100 cr worth of materials to construct a Tiny Device (AC 5, 1 hp).

During this time, their arms, legs, and air-breathing lungs develop. Adult Chagrians are truly amphibious, retaining their ability to breathe underwater while also able to function without difficulty in air. They also possess acute low-light vision.\r\n\r\nThe average Chagrian stands taller than a Human. They are distinguished by two fleshy growths protruding from the sides of their heads, which they call lethorns. As they age, the lethorns thicken. Males also sport two horns growing from the top of their skulls. These were once used in underwater duels to attract a mate, and are seen as a sign of the males' strength and virility. Females lack the superior cranial horns, but had more pronounced and longer posterior head plates; these can reach halfway down their back. Chagrians also have very long black forked tongues.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nAs a species, Chagrians are generally peaceful and law-abiding to the point of becoming stoic and obstinate. Many Chagrians are motivated only by basic desires such as sustenance, shelter, and healthcare. Chagrian government ensures that every citizen is cared and provided for, so the standard of living for the poorest Chagrian is high compared to the members of other species. Chagrians who expect violence often wear red.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nChagrian names have a very melodic tone. Male names are typically shorter than female names. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Bom, Chen, Fiet, Nedd, Touk\r\n\r\n**Female Names.**  Chavik, Dabai, Fisil, Oolya, Tinto\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Kassin, Molya, Nigna, Onirali, Treen\r\n\r\n### Chagrian Traits\r\nAs a Chagrian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Chagrians reach adulthood in their late teens and live an average of 75 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Chagrians' peace-loving nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Chagrians typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Natural Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).\r\n\r\n***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Chagri.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Chevin\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Grey|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Black, brown, blond, grey, or white (usually with age)|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Stocky build, large heads, long snouts, long arms, three-fingered hands, four-toed feet|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|5'9\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|170 lb.|x(2d6) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Vinsoth|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Chevin|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nChevin have long snouts which hang down nearly to their ankles. Combined with their intellect, this makes them skilled hunters of animals such as backshin, because they can smell out their prey or feed while keeping their eyes on the horizon. It is also their hunting prowess which allowed them to dominate their homeworld and conquer the Chevs. Chevin have thick legs, massive wide bodies, thin rope-like tails, and arms so long their three-fingered hands often brushed the ground.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nChevin live in small, mobile communities, with homes mounted on great wheeled carts. Even after they gained access to galactic technology, they continued to live as nomads (though more affluent Chevin mounted their lodges on large repulsorlift vehicles instead.) Their Chev slaves are usually forced to follow on foot. Nomadic groups of Chevin keep in touch via comlinks, and often converge on a single location to deal with danger.\r\n\r\nThe only Chevin settlements that stay in place for more than one standard month are the Government Villages, where Chevin dictators live with their hand-picked advisors. Even these settlements are movable when necessary. Each of the roughly two dozen Government Villages rules a Chevin nation.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nChevin names do not vary significantly based on gender. Surnames are based on community.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Buula, Ephant, Perre, Phylus, Reseros\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Meh, Mon, Nen, Needmo, Phrusaani\r\n\r\n### Chevin Traits\r\nAs a Chevin, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Chevin reach adulthood in their thirties and live up to 200 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Chevin warmongering and slavetrading cause them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Chevin stand between 6 and 8 feet tall and weigh up to 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to both hot and cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\r\n\r\n***Keen Hearing.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.\r\n\r\n***Nomadic.*** You are proficient in Survival.\r\n\r\n***Thick Skull.*** Your skull is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Chevin. The Chevin language is characterized by grunts and low-pitched rumblings. Chevin typically have deep voices, even when speaking Basic.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Chironian\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Brown, gold, or red|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Black, brown, gold, or red|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Red to gold|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Two transparent horns, centauriform|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |6'0\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |450 lb.|x(2d8) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Chiron|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Chironan|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe chironian lower body has four legs, similar to that of a horse, and each ends in a dainty, cloven hoof. A chironian can sit down by folding his or her horse-like legs underneath the body. Chironians can also kick backward with both hind legs; this strong kick is sufficient to knock over other beings. A chironian's pace can vary between a walk, a canter, and a gallop.\r\n\r\nEach year, chironian heads grows two horns above the temples. These horns start as small knobs covered by red-furred velvet: a vascular tissue. Once the knobs have grown sufficiently, they break through the velvet naturally, emerging as transparent horns, as bright as diamond, cool to the touch and with smooth ridges. However, if the velvet is cut artificially, chironians can die from the injury. Over time, the horns grow long and sharp enough that adolescent chironians can use them to gore opponents.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nChironians express emotions through the mannerisms of their hooves: when impatient, they stamp them; when excited, they tap them in a quick dance, or canter in a spot. The centauriforms frequently shake their heads and manes, and when angry, their faces flush a deeper shade. Young chironians, when frightened, are known to rub or press their velvet-covered horns against the foreheads of other beings to whom they are emotionally close.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nChironian names are soft and melodic, despite the thick nature of their native language. Important family names are passed down through generations. They don't use surnames. \r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Jefin, Slaturn, Cinall, Leathes\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Olachi, Luna, Sinall, Trespen\r\n\r\n### Chironian Traits\r\nAs a chironian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Chironians reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Chironians tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Chironians typically stand 6 to 8 feet tall and generally weigh about 600 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.\r\n\r\n***Cultured.*** You have proficiency in the Lore skill.\r\n\r\n***Equine Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples. Additionally, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your hooves. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot. Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your equine back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue to act independently, not as a controlled mount.\r\n\r\n***Hooves and Horns.*** Your hooves (and depending on your age, horns) are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Powerful Charge.*** If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line before hitting with a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to trip the target prone as part of the same attack. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Chironan. Chironan is characterized by its soft, melodic sounds.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Clawdite\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Green to yellow|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Yellow, gold, or blue|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Shapechanging capabilities|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'11\"|+2d8\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |95 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Zolan|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Clawdite|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nIn their natural form, clawdites resemble reptilian humanoids, having evolved from reptomammals. They have sunken cheeks with a narrow nose, a small mouth, large eyes with slit-like pupils, and a thin line that runs down their foreheads, creasing their nose. Clawdites possess an extremely rare ability to change their appearance. They can change the color and texture of their skin and eyes, and even grow hair, to mimic other species, though they cannot add significant physical mass to their bodies. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nBy nature, clawdites are quiet and solitary beings, often shunning the company of others unless it benefits them. Due to their nature as shapeshifters, they are often mistrusted by strangers. Consequently, they view the galaxy pragmatically, and are often harsh realists.\r\n\r\nNot all clawdites use their shapeshifting abilities due to the pain the transformation causes. These clawdites are often inclined to remain on their homeworld of Zolan, avoiding the company of other species.\r\n\r\nOn Zolan, clawdites are feared and shunned by the zolanders, who are a deeply religious people, believing that clawdites are impure and sinful. Zolanders force clawdites to live in slums scattered across the planet.\r\n\r\nThose clawdites who leave their homeworld tend to gravitate toward professions that celebrate their shapeshifting, such as smuggling, bounty hunting, or espionage.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nClawdite names often have a rolling or hissing quality to them. Surnames are familial, though clawdites rarely use them.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Nuri, Pol, Renneyn, Rosat, Turman\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Bargu, Cato, Murna, Sora, Zam\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Durra, Noviee, Parasitti, Virten, Wesell\r\n\r\n### Clawdite Traits\r\nAs a clawdite, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Clawdites reach adulthood in their early teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Clawdites' pragmatism cause them to tend towards neutral balanced, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Clawdites typically stand 5 to 7 feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Changeling Instincts.*** You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, Insight, and Persuasion\r\n\r\n***Shapechanger.*** As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait. You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.\r\n\r\n***Unsettling Visage.*** When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, Clawdite, and one more language of your choice. Clawdite is characterized by its rolling sounds paired with hissing sibilants.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Codru-Ji\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Light to dark tones|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Black, brown, gray, or white (usually with age)|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Black, slate, gray, or brown|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Four arms|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'6\"|+2d8\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |90 lb.|x(2d6) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Munto Codru|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Codruese|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nCodru-Ji are humanoids generally near-human in their adult appearances, save for their four arms. While their hair, eye, and skin pigmentations tend towards earthen hues, brighter colorations such as blonde hair or blue eyes, though uncommon, also exist. Rarer still, some adults maintain a light coat of fur or elongated, pointed ears. These eccentric attributes result from their unusual childhood forms.\r\n\r\nCodru-Ji children are actually sapient, six-legged canid creatures that cannot speak. Codru-Ji in this stage of their lives are called Wyrwulves: they mature to their more recognizable figures after reaching puberty. At that point, a blue, rubbery substance cocoons a Wyrwulf for several weeks before it emerges as a humanoid adolescent. They do, however, retain both the natural resilience and the enhanced hearing of their previous selves.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe Codru-Ji are proud and protective of their ancient customs, and they carefully manage their homeworld's economy to keep a degree of anonymity from the galaxy at large. They fear the tainting of their long-held practices by outside influence as well as prejudice against them for the almost barbaric level of callousness they will display towards one another in pursuit of personal gain. The kidnapping of a political rivals' children or the ransoming of off-worlders back to their people are both common practices. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nCodru-Ji names are often kept to two syllables. Clan names are appended to the given name as a hyphenated affix.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Kossok, Tirrit, Uttar, Yunnan\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Davvi, Kella, Russa, Zollu \r\n\r\n**Clan Names.** -Fa, -Mu, Ro-, -Sy, Yi-\r\n\r\n### Codru-Ji Traits\r\nAs a codru-ji, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Codru-Ji reach adulthood in their early teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Steeped in selfish tradition, Codru-Ji tend towards the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Codru-Ji stand 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh around 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Four-Armed.*** Codru-Ji have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n***Keen Hearing.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.\r\n\r\n***Natural Grappler.*** Whenever you make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple you are considered to have expertise in the Athletics skill.\r\n\r\n***Trance.*** You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Codruese, which has a solemn and stately cadence to it.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Colicoid\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Brown, green, or purple|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Orange, purple, red, or yellow|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Carnivorous insectoids, four legs, defensive \"ball mode\"|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'2\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |120 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Colla IV|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Colicoid|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nColicoids are tall insectoids that held multiple appendages. Their bodies are chitinous and include a powerful stinging tail. A colicoid's physiology allows them to curl up into a protective ball and unfurl suddenly which allow them to catch their prey unaware. This rolling method of locomotion is second nature to the colicoids. Their insectoid minds provide them a natural defense against mind tricks. \r\n\r\nSome members are colicoid queens that are different as they are more than twice the size of even the largest warrior breeds. This makes them extremely dangerous and are the only colicoids that possess a unique poisonous stinger. This combined with their strength and size makes them deadly combatants, especially when within their nests. However, a queen tends to only fight when her young are being threatened.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThough highly intelligent, colicoids are emotionless and cannibalistic in nature. Their ruthless cunning serves them well on the battlefield as it does on the negotiating table. It is known that long ago that they transferred these ruthless characteristics to their commerce activities. As a result, they are known to be brutally efficient in their business practices. They are noted for being vicious and calculating creatures that are driven by greed whilst showing little regard for others. The colicoids have numerous successful commercial ventures and hold strict business protocols. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nColicoid names are typically very short and gender neutral, with surnames being based on the queen from which they spawned. \r\n\r\n**First Names.** Gal, Het, Kaf, Lyp, Nok, Yin\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Bek, Dor, Set, Tel, Wim, Zal\r\n\r\n### Coilicoid Traits\r\nAs a colicoid, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Strength or Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Colicoids reach adulthood by 8 and live to be about 65.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Colicoid's emotionless nature causes them to tend towards balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Colicoids typically stand 6 to 6 and a half feet tall and generally weigh about 170 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Acute Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill. \r\n\r\n***Cannibalize.*** If you spend at least 1 minute devouring the corpse of a beast or humanoid, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n***Closed Mind.*** Colicoid brains have an unusual composition which gives them a natural defense against the Force. You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.\r\n\r\n***Defensive Ball.*** You are able to curl into a rolling ball for extra protection. When you take the Dash action while you aren't wielding a shield, you gain a bonus to AC equal to half your proficiency bonus until the start of your next turn. \r\n\r\n***Natural Armor.*** Due to your carapace and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your carapace provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.\r\n\r\n***Stinger.*** Your stinger is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Colicoid. The Colicoid language uses sounds produced by the antennae and jointed legs of the colicoids, including humming sounds and clicks, which makes it difficult for other species to speak.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Culisetto\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Pink, yellow|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |White|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Red|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Thoracic carapace|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |2'8\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |35 lb.|x1 lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Culiset|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Culisetto|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe culisetto are an insectoid species, with a close resemblance to the common fly. Their long snouts are not truly proboscises, but function much the same, allowing them to drain blood with the aid of two tendrils, one on either side of the snout. They move by crawling about on their hands and feet, and are adept at leaping and climbing.\r\n\r\nDespite their appearance, culisetto are an exceptionally hygenic species, with an evolved habit of rubbing their hands and legs to rid them of germs from the ground.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nCulisetto are often shunned by other species, if not for their grotesque appearance, then usually for their habit of drinking blood. They prefer to do so while their victims are alive, but tolerate it if they are recently dead. While they have evolved beyond needing to drink blood to survive, its taste remains quite enticing to many culisetto, who will indulge in it at their pleasure.\r\n\r\nCulisetto tend to favor the company of their own kind, particularly their siblings. Broodlings frequently travel in groups of three or more, inseparable from birth.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nCulisetto names are distinctively antiquated in their etymology. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Kreon, Sosilu, Ocyto, Phino\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Hecuba, Anophe, Xeina, Adeia\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Dengue, Chontos, Kazan, Vazil\r\n\r\n### Culisetto Traits\r\n\r\nAs a culisetto, you have the following traits:\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Culisetto reach adulthood at 8 years old, and live to be about 60.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Culisettos' thirst for blood cause them to tend towards the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Culisetto stand between 3 and 4 feet tall and weigh about 45 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Cannibalize.*** If you spend at least 1 minute devouring the corpse of a beast or humanoid, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n***Climb.*** You have a climbing speed of 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Compound Eyes.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check related to sight, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.\r\n\r\n***Powerful Leap.*** If you jump at least 10 feet in a straight line before hitting with a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to trip the target as part of the same attack. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Prehensile Feet.*** You have supreme control over your feet and can use them to manipulate objects as well as your hands.\r\n\r\n***Strong-Legged.*** When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier.\r\n\r\n***Surprise Attack.*** If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it. You can use this trait only once per combat.\r\n\r\n***Torpor.*** You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits.\r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons.

Along with their resistance to the Force, Dashade possess a high tolerance for radioactive energy, able to withstand contact with radioactive materials much longer than other species.\r\n\r\nDespite the thick skin Dashade possess, they have the uncanny ability to control the rate that heat dissipates from their skin. This allows them to regulate their body temperature at will.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nDashade's brute strength and Force resistance makes them prime candidates for mercenary and assassin work. \r\n\r\nDashade society is clan-based. Theses clan's often feud over honor and reputation, a trait that the dashade as a species exhibit.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nMany dashade names are short, dominated by harsher sounds, while others are longer and seperated by an apostrophe.

Defel have the ability to bend waves of light in such a manner that it renders them practically invisible to the human eye. Despite this ability, they could be still be spotted by force-users and keen-eyed individuals.\r\n\r\nDefel have extremely high perceptive ability because of their large ears, sensitive noses, and keen eyes. Because of the heightened levels of visual stimuli their eyes experience, defel are nearly blinded by sunlight but  can see rather well in the dark.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nDefel live in tight-knit, interdependent communites underground. The harsh environment on Af'El turned the defel into rugged survivors, able to hold their own in the Galaxy. \r\n\r\nDefel have a strong sense of honor and will not associate with individuals that do not keep their word.\r\n\r\nBecause defel have yet to achieve interplanetary travel, they are a rare sight in the galaxy.\r\n\r\n### Defel Names\r\nDefel names tend to sound dark and mysterious, and are mostly composed of multiple syllables. Defel surnames are familial, using stern and simple sounds.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Alustair, Claustro, Tenebris, Varsiin\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Lhantra, Soliel, Stroika, Zavtra\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Gauss, Neura, Tume, Vecherom\r\n\r\n### Defel Traits\r\nAs a defel, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Defel reach adulthood in their early teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Defel tend toward no particular alignment.

Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage and have the finesse property.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Hidden Step.*** As a bonus action, you can turn invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you've used this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Miners.*** You have proficiency in scavenging kits.\r\n\r\n***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.\r\n\r\n***Sneaky*** You are proficient in the Stealth skill.\r\n\r\n***Surprise Attack*** If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it.

They often make appearances as angelic figures in the folklore of numerous species. Their bodies naturally give off an intense light, obfuscating their physical forms to the naked eye. They have three pairs of thin, translucent wings that appear fragile, but are more than capable of flight. Diathim have been known to survive in the vacuum of space without the need for protective gear, and have a mild hypnotic effect on others in their presence, adding to the legends surrounding them.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe diathim give off an aura of kindness, and are consistently described as benevolent by spacers, causing tales of their rare appearances to morph over time into the grandiose mythology of the \"Angels.\" The diathim are reputed for their beauty, and the way in which they appear varies depending on the beholder. Diathim are fascinated by spacecraft, which often prompted them to mob any ships that found themselves in the vicinity of their homeworld Iego and its largest moon Millius Prime.\r\n\r\nDiathim have only commonly been seen gathering in flocks to welcome arriving ships, and knowledge of their habitat remains a mystery to outsiders. Although they have no apparent language of their own, they have readily adopted Galactic Basic, the common language of the galaxy.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nTraditional diathim names are difficult to pronounce. When among other species, they tend to simply go by shortened nicknames for others to refer to them by.\r\n\r\n**Birth Names.** Aiubhirr'merh, D'yz'xarh, Ihuithrhe, Vyxendel'ahitraxr\r\n\r\n**Nicknames.** Mirra, Diz, Huu, Vix\r\n\r\n### Diathim Traits\r\nAs a diathim, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Diathim reach adulthood in their late teens and live about 100 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Diathim are naturally empathetic, causing them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Diathim typically stand 6 to 9 feet tall and generally weigh about 100 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Type.*** Your creature type is both aberration and humanoid.\r\n\r\n***Celestial Physiology.*** You can survive for one day within the vacuum of space.\r\n\r\n***Enthralling Hypnosis.*** You can use your psychic aura to influence individuals of both sexes. Whenever you roll a 1 on a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Additionally, once per short or long rest, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower on a Charisma check as a 10. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n***Flight.*** You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. While wearing medium or heavy armor, your flying speed is reduced by half.\r\n\r\n***Fragile.*** Diathim are too weak to pack much of a punch. You have disadvantage on Strength saving throws, and when determining your bonus to attack and damage rolls for weapon attacks using Strength, you can\ufffdt add more than +3.\r\n\r\n***Luminescent Aura.*** Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to amplify your radiant aura, causing a searing light to radiate from you. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within 10 feet of you take psychic damage equal to half your level (rounded up).

They were large, aggressive-looking humanoids with chin horns, sharp claws, thick skin, and had poor eyesight but superior senses of hearing and smell. Dowutin are massive humanoids who can live for centuries, and dying of old age is unheard of for them. While most other species become frail as they age, Dowutin never stop growing and getting stronger. As teenagers, Dowutin resemble Wookiees in size and strength, but by their fifth century, they are a mountain of muscle weighing a metric ton, with loud footsteps and voices warning other species away.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nDowutin are a very straightforward people, and their society is among the most simple in the galaxy. They have few cities, governments, or even organized social structures, as they often survive entirely on their own. Children are left behind by their families at a very young age and must learn to fend for themselves. Because of this, those who quickly learned hunting skills survived. Their size and strength made them prized as hired muscle, but most Dowutins' pride dissuaded them from such work, as they viewed other species as weak, absolutely refusing to take orders from anyone who is physically weaker than them. As such, those who employ Dowutin will command them in more subtle ways, typically phrasing their commands as suggestions or advice. Strength in the literal sense is very important to them; it is a measure of worth and earns them respect. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nDowutin names are harsh and guttural, and roll off the tongue like a rock slide. Dowutin do not use surnames.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Dursuc, Grimgorl, Maucro, Tornak\r\n\r\n### Dowutin Traits\r\nAs a dowutin, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Dowutins are considered a child until around the age of 75 in which they are a full fledged adult. Dowutins can live upwards of 900 years with even more ancient ones exceeding that.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Dowutins are aggressive and brash, causing them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Dowutins have a unique special characteristic; from birth to death, they never stop growing. Even as an adolescent, dowutins tend to tower over other species, reaching heights over 8 feet and weighing 400 pounds. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Claws.*** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme cold.\r\n\r\n***Hunter.*** You have proficiency in the Survival skill.\r\n\r\n***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing or smell.\r\n\r\n***Powerful Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Dowuta. Dowuta consists of deep, booming vocalizations and is considered difficult for members of other species to emulate. \r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Draethos\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Grey, pink, blue, purple, black|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Black, brown, red|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Four fingers, large teeth, telepathy, long life spans|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'5\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |130 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Draethos|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Draethos|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nDraethos possess large teeth, which grow outside of their mouths. Coupled with their lack of lips, this leads to the appearance of an overbite. Their scaly skin ranged in color from blue to purple to black. Their hands retain an interstitial web between the fingers. Their fingers end in narrow tips which resemble claws. They possess low-light vision, springing from their cave-dwelling ancestors.\r\n\r\nDraethos possess a limited telepathy, granting the ability to communicate with any sentient being. The ability is limited to communication; a Draethos can not invade the thoughts of others.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nPartly due to their long lives, Draethos society was slow to evolve and relies heavily on tradition. The Draethos' culture is warrior-based, and those living on the homeworld are expected to demonstrate their martial or hunting prowess. Life on Draethos is harsh, with arrogant aristocrats squabbling among one another for social standing and wealth. Warriors are perpetually in high demand as gladiators, mercenaries, hunters, and soldiers. Those who make a conscious decision to abandon the way of the warrior are exiled to seek a new life among aliens. Consequently, despite their reputation as fierce combatants, most Draethos encountered offworld are peaceful and intellectual.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nDue to their lack of lips, Draethos names typically lack hard consonants. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Odan, Gyeto, Hurl, Jan, Talon\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Gillen, Teria, Kat'h, Yul, Aswe\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Urr, Slyter, Qelu'tlapa, Ayahu, Jek\r\n\r\n### Draethos Traits\r\nAs a draethos, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Draethos reach adulthood around their late teens and live up to 800 years. \r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Draethos tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Draethos typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 190 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Telepathy.*** You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of you. You must share a language with the target in order to communicate in this way.\r\n\r\n***Way of the Warrior.*** You have proficiency with light and medium armor as well as vibroblades and vibroswords.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Draethos.

Their primary means of locomotion is their strong arms, and their lower limbs and feet were used for grappling and other fine motor manipulation. They hardly ever walk on their lower limbs. Although most Dugs may walk on all four limbs, others like to use their strong arms as legs and their feet as hands like they would normally do.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nDue to their oppression under their Gran rulers who colonized Malastare, many Dugs often feel the need to throw around their strength in bids to establish dominance. As a result, they are known for their ill-tempered demeanor, and many are bullying thugs.\r\n\r\nOn their homeworld of Malastare, the vast majority of Dugs are little more than laborers toiling for the enrichment of the Gran. With the species excluded from much of the power and money on Malastare, many Dugs turn to swoop racing or bounty hunting as their only means to achieve fame and fortune. In all other areas, the Dugs are exploited.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nDug names are often 3 syllables long, mostly through big sounds rather than harsh tones. There are harsher tones in their names as well though, often in the forms of x's and k's. Female Dugs have softer names, but no one would call them beautiful. Surnames are usually passed down through family or clan.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Bawugri, Gadwouhx, Rorgukwa, \r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Bosix, Grugne, Jiwous, Pragiba, \r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Brundaare, Gninsaidi, Kedwir, Randaine\r\n\r\n### Dug Traits\r\nAs a dug, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Dugs reach adulthood in their early teens and live an average of 75 years. Their violent nature often leads to violent ends.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Dugs' angry nature causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Dugs typically stand between 3 and 4 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Courageous.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\r\n\r\n***Fisticuffs.*** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage and have the finesse property.\r\n\r\n***Fury of the Small.*** When you damage a creature with an attack or a power and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or power to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Menacing.*** You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.\r\n\r\n***Strong and Small.*** You have a climbing speed of 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Powerful Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.\r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields. Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Dug.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Echani\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Pale tones|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |White|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Silver|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Fair skin, white hair and eyes, remarkable familial similarity.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'1\"|+1d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |105 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Eshan|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Galactic Basic|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nEchani are characterized by their white skin, hair, and eyes, and their remarkable tendency to look very much alike one another to outside observers, particularly amongst family members. It is thought that their origins stem from Arkanian experimentation on the human genome, a hypothesis that could explain their physical conformity.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nA matriarchal, caste-based society originating from the Inner Rim world of Eshan, the echani spread to encompass a confederacy of six worlds including Bengali and Thyrsus, known as the Six Sisters, governed by the all-female Echani Command. \r\n\t\r\nEchani generals are sometimes seen by others as having the ability to predict their opponent's next move. This is no biologicial trait inherent to the species, but rather stems from the fact that combat is so ingrained into every level of echani culture; the echani hold to the idea that combat is the truest form of communication, and to know someone fully, you must fight them. While their combat rituals require complete freedom of movement and unarmed martial arts, in warfare, they tend towards light armor and melee weapons, and are considered excellent craftsmen of such.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nEchani names tend to lack hard consonants, but are otherwise as variable as human ones. Echani surnames are tied directly to their place in the caste system.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Caelian, Inarin, Losor, Uelis, Yusanis \r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Astri, Brianna, Isena, Raskta, Senriel\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Authal, Elysi, Fenni, Kinro, Lsu\r\n\r\n### Echani Traits\r\nAs an Echani, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Echani reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Echani culture's emphasis on honor and combat cause them to tend towards lawful alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Echani stand between 5 and a half and 6 feet tall and weigh around 150 lbs, with little variation between them.

On a success you learn one of the following traits about that creature: it's Strength, Dexterity or Constitution score; bonus to Strength, Dexterity or Constitution saving throws; armor class; or current hit points. On a failure, the target becomes immune to this feature for one day. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once).

They also have small black eyes. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nIn terms of society, their race's culture resembles that of a hive society though each individual retain their own thoughts and aspirations yet all being bred for a specific role that they were eager to fulfill. A caste system is present amongst the esh-kha which included Force-sensitive simple minded savants, more numerous skilled determined warriors that watched over them and finally the patriarchs that acted as leaders who provided their wisdom as well as decisions to their entire people. Esh-kha appear to outsiders as a savage violent species that care only for the destruction of all other races. This hatred for other sentient species is believed to had stemmed from their tightly-knit hive-like society. It is suspected that the esh-kha are simply unable to tolerate or even adapt to the existence of thinking of outsiders who only suffered their wrath. Their race only turns violent against one another in the most extreme of circumstances.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nWhilst their kind are individuals, esh-kha are not named at birth but instead earn their names through their actions. An esh-kha that displayed great skill in battle could be called \"Swift Blade\", or maybe \"Deadly Cutter\" or some other such name. It is believed that this partly explained an esh-kha's zeal in battle with young warriors seeking not only victory but an opportunity to lay claim to a name and forge their own identity. Esh-kha do not use surnames, as they believe they are one family.\r\n\r\n**Names.** Bleeding Yell, Dormant Heart, Blue Survivor, Ancient Cull, Sharp Grip, Running Sun, Flame Walker\r\n\r\n### Esh-kha Traits\r\nAs an esh-kha, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength or Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Esh-kha reach adulthood in their early teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** The esh-kha's stubborn and racially-centric mindsets cause them to tend toward lawful balanced, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Esh-kha typically stand 6 to 6 and a half feet tall and generally weigh about 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. \r\n\r\n***Force-Sensitive.*** You know your choice of the *turbulence*, *force disarm*, or *slow* at-will force powers. Your forcecasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma (depending on power alignment). \r\n\r\n***Inquisitive.*** You have proficiency in the Investigation skill. \r\n\r\n***Savage Attacks.*** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.\r\n\r\n***Skill Versatility.*** You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency in two vibroweapons or blasters of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Kharan.

The sleek symmetry of their features, calculating and cold demeanors, their exotic looks, and their ability to alter their skin pigmentation make the Falleen often considered to be among the most aesthetically pleasing beings in the galaxy. In addition to their strikingly beautiful appearance, the Falleen exude pheromones which makes them all but irresistible to both sexes.\r\n\r\nThe Falleen are semi-aquatic, being able to hold their breath underwater for an extended period of time. Fallen are one of few species that are resistant to manipulation by the Force.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nFalleen society is of a feudal nature, with noble houses ruling over the lower classes. The upper echelons of Falleen aristocracy are rife with politics and intrigue, though they rarely spill blood over disputes or reduce themselves to open warfare.\r\n\r\nAs a cold-blooded species, the Falleen respect discipline and control, particularly self-control. They tend to shun public displays of emotion, and are very patient. As a result of this attitude, they tend to look down on the more openly passionate, whom they see as lacking self-control. Indeed, the Falleen as a species have a towering sense of superiority, reflecting on their view of Falleen as the civilized and cultural center of the galaxy, rather than Coruscant.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nFalleen favor names with Z and X sounds. They are usually accompanied by a surname, which is familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Xomit, Xizor, Xist, Zenex, Zurros\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Xora, Trezza, Mylla, Zule, Annaz\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Grunseit, Croom, Moz, Xiss, Mythric\r\n\r\n### Falleen Traits\r\nAs a Falleen, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Falleen reach adulthood in their late teens and live up to 250 years. \r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Falleen societal structure causes them to tend to be lawful balanced, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Falleen typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh around 165 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Closed Mind.*** Falleen brains have an unusual composition which make them resistant to influence from the Force. You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.\r\n\r\n***Enthralling Pheromones.*** You can use your pheromones to influence individuals of both sexes. Whenever you roll a 1 on a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Additionally, once per short or long rest, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower on a Charisma check as a 10. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n***Hold Breath.*** You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time.\r\n\r\n***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Falleen.

Both their arms and legs end in four, large webbed digits with suction-cup fingertips. Springing from the underside of each forearm is a second short arm, ending in three large and agile fingers. A Felucian's head is a thick mass of long flexible tendrils featuring illuminated tips. The eyes and mouth appear as black holes or openings within this mass.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nFelucians are mysterious sentient beings native to the vast fungal swamps and jungles of Felucia. Though Felucia has long been colonized, the native Felucians avoided notice by living deep in the jungle. Such seclusion was easily maintained. Even the hardiest of colonists were loath to brave the perils of the dangerous wilderness without cause.\r\n\r\nThe Felucians are an unusual, amphibious species. They are highly adapted to surviving the wilds of their home planet, and fade easily into its confusing mass of plant life. They are equally at home on land or in the water, and they traverse the swamps with ease.\r\n\r\nAll Felucians are part of a single, planetwide tribe that is broken down into smaller villages and communities, each one led by shamans and chieftains. These shamans are very strong in the Force, using it to their own ends with incredible skill.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nFelucian names are usually two syllables and full of hard consonants. Surnames are a combination of tribe lineage.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Gokkuul, Kargrek, Hagark, Ruggorn\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Lakko, Taarell, Duuna, Frula \r\n\r\n**Surnames.** s'Gokuul, d'Lakko, s'Kargrek, d'Frula\r\n\r\n### Felucian Traits\r\nAs a Felucian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Felucians reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Felucians' connection to the Living Force causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Felucians typically stand over 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Force-Sensitive.*** You know the *burst* at-will force power. When you reach 3rd level, you learn and can cast the *beast trick* force power once per day. When you reach 5th level, you learn and can cast the *plant surge* force power once per day. Wisdom is your forcecasting ability for these powers.\r\n\r\n***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.\r\n\r\n***Stealthy.*** You are proficient in the Stealth skill.\r\n\r\n***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, Felucianese, and one more language of your choice.

A life above ground and in caves has led the flesh raiders to lose their more amphibian traits, and are now more humanoid in their biological needs, though they seem to only be able to digest meats and flesh.\r\n\r\nFlesh raiders keep many of their ancestral rakatan features, though they have experienced a form of gigantism that has lead to their interesting appearance, that of a flat topped, spade shaped head, with blade-like eye stalks coming off the side ends of the spade. Their body structure also more closely matches that of a trandoshan or dashade, being bulky and imposing in stature, towering over most other sentient creatures.\r\n\r\nUnlike contemporary rakata, flesh raiders did not lose their ability to tap into the Force.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nFlesh raiders are known to form small clan structures, with a war boss in charge of the clan. Those flesh raiders who are born Force-sensitive can be found imitating a temple structure, with a powerful Force-sensitive, usually from another species, leading them. \r\n\r\nFlesh raiders still speak the rakatan language, though it has developed into a cruder variant.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nFlesh  raider names tend to be short and concise, embodying strength and virility. Flesh raider names make no distinction between male and female names. Surnames are clan-based, though they are rarely used.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Cha'nagh, Fashk, Gorshh, Keshk, Mar'govrok\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Ban, Fel, Kuir, Penk, Teeshk\r\n\r\n### Flesh Raider Traits\r\nAs a flesh raider, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Flesh raiders reach adulthoood by 20 and rarely live longer than 90 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Flesh raiders' propensity towards war and aggression cause them to tend toward chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Flesh raiders typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.\r\n\r\n***Cannibalize.*** If you spend at least 1 minute devouring the corpse of a beast or humanoid, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Force Contention.*** Due to their unique physiology, flesh raider hardiness allows them to overcome use of the Force. You have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws against force powers.\r\n\r\n***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.\r\n\r\n***Hunters.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Survival) check to hunt for food, you are considered to have expertise in the Survival skill.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Rakata. Rakata is characterized by its deep tones and simplistic nature, using mainly consonants and long vowels. It's script seems to be a very ancient form of Galactic Basic.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Gand\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Varying shades of brown, green, and purple|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Brown, black, green, or silver|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Exoskeletons, three-fingered hands|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|4'1\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|75 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Gand|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Gand|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nGand are sentient, stocky humanoids whose insectoid bodies are covered in a chitinous exoskeleton. The natural armor allow the Gand to shrug off injuries that would cripple most other species. The exoskeleton provides extra protection in the clavicle region, which prevented most nerve or pressure-point strikes to the neck and shoulders. In addition, Gands have the remarkable ability to regrow lost limbs. If a Gand is dismembered, it can regrow a lost limb in a few days. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nGand society places heavy importance on the achievements of an individual and holds that an individual has no name, and thus no worth, until he or she proves otherwise. The speech patterns of Gands utilize third-person self-reference within each level of identity earned. Young or unproven Gands are all called \"Gand,\" as they are considered merely aspects of the same whole. Major accomplishments earn the use of a family surname. Mastering a skill, such as becoming a findsman, allows for the use of the given name, all with third-person self-reference. This manner of speaking is common within the spoken and written Gand language but is more predominant when a Gand speaks Basic; it is often a source of amusement to outsiders.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nUntil a Gand has earned the use of a name, they go simply by the term \"Gand.\" Gand speak in the third person and refer to themselves by name. Often, when a Gand feels shamed, they will stop referring to themselves by their name and revert to calling themselves \"Gand\" until they prove themselves again. Male and female names are not distinct.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** C'nyir, Dash, Iglid, Kyuffax, T'rix\r\n\r\n**Surname.** Diqlu, Krakee, Praafri, Quudya, Zooq\r\n\r\n### Gand Traits\r\nAs a Gand, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Gand reach adulthood when they earn their name, which is usually in their teens, and live to be about 70 on average.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Gand tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Gand stand 4 to 6 feet tall and weigh around 100 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Exoskeleton.*** You have a thick exoskeleton. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n***Gand Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).\r\n\r\n***Lungless.*** Gand do not have lungs, and therefore do not need to breathe.\r\n\r\n***Regenerative.*** When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Hit Die to regain hit points as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Gand. The Gand language does not use pronouns as Gand refer to themselves in the third person, so often Gand who speak Galactic Basic are difficult to understand.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Gank\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Yellow or yellowish-brown|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Brown or black|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Red, green, blue, or white|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Always armored, cybernetic communication|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'9\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |115 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Nar Shaddaa (possibly)|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Gank|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe ganks are a species of fur-covered carnivores. The typical member of the species has a face that is squared-off and yellow in color, the expression trapped in a perpetual snarl that non-ganks find unattractive. Small, mean-looking eyes peer from above the maw, their head sitting atop a thick neck between broad, strong shoulders. These cap two thickset, powerful arms, which terminate in hands with five fingers each. Their heavy build affords ganks great strength, yet they are also spry runners. They augment their bodies with cybernetics, making them a species of cyborgs.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nPrecious little is known about gank culture. The exception is that the ganks are fabled for their violent and ruthless nature; even the slightest perceived insult is enough to throw a gank into a violent rage of retaliation. Outsiders similarly know little of the organization of gank society, or whether they have any central rulers at all. What is well known was that the ganks are a war-loving and regimented species, whose members enjoy occupations that allow them to fight and shed blood, such as that of assassin, bodyguard, bounty hunter, and mercenary. They are in particular demand by the hutts, who have enough ganks on retainer to constitute a small army. Their warlike ways and physical strength ranks the ganks among the galaxy's most redoubtable fighters. The species have no compunctions about premeditated murder, which lends them the nickname \"Gank Killers.\"\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nGank names do not differentiate between genders, and instead of surnames, they give themselves epithets. \r\n\r\n**First Names.** Darakk, Frent, Shett, Yorrath\r\n\r\n**Epithets.** the Feared, the Keen, the Slayer, the Tough\r\n\r\n### Gank Traits\r\nAs a gank, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity or Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Ganks reach adulthood in their late teens and live for slightly more than a century thanks to their cybernetics.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Ganks aggressive and hair trigger nature causes them to tend towards chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Ganks typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 35 feet. You ignore the strength property of heavy armor.\r\n\r\n***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.\r\n\r\n***Athletic.*** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.\r\n\r\n***Gank Training.*** You have proficiency in light and medium armor as well as two vibroweapons or blasters of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Mercenary Specialization.*** You have proficiency in one of the following skills: Intimidation, Persuasion, Stealth, or Perception.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Gank.

Geonosians are strong despite their thin builds, and are capable of constructing massive hives and factories in concert. The head of a Geonosian is elongated and large with their skulls ridged on the top and by the side where they have bulbous, thick-lidded eyes. Both are physically strong and covered with bony ridges which protected their arms, legs, and vital organs. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nGeonosian society is caste-based with little upward mobility, though some of the lower caste do develop ambition. Workers are conditioned to loathe even the concept of separation from their hive and the system of control. A low-ranking worker's normal life is one of endless toil and labor to satisfy the aristocracy, who are known to make spectacular demands. The warrior caste tend to be highly competitive and are eager to prove themselves. They are born with an abnormal level of intelligence, and one of their only hopes of escape from their rigid duty is entering voluntarily into gladiatorial combat. Should they survive, they are granted freedom. Ultimately, their society exist to benefit those few members that reside in the upper caste. Members of the aristocratic classes are known to be ambitious, domineering, and manipulative. They constantly move towards improving their standing and holdings while sumultaneously working to ruin their rivals.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nGeonosian names are usually harsh sounding. Lower castes don't get surnames. Upper caste surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Buck, Goshey, Nik, Sozz, Techtu\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Datte, Kida, Miri, Nare, Tenessi\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Chak, Hor, Lur, Marpes, Zol\r\n\r\n### Geonosian Traits\r\nAs a geonosian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** You Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution or Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Geonosians reach adulthood at 10 and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Geonosians' greedy and self-serving nature causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Geonosians typically stand from 5 to 6 feet tall and rarely weigh more than 80 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Crafter.*** Geonosian culture promotes artisanry. You have proficiency in one set of artisan's implements of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Exoskeleton.*** You have a thick exoskeleton. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n***Flight.*** You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. While wearing medium or heavy armor, your flying speed is reduced by half.\r\n\r\n***Geonosian Weaponry.*** You have proficiency in blasters that deal sonic damage.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Geonosian. The Geonosian language consists of click consonants through use of a Geonosians' dual mandibles.

Their facial features include many sharp downward angles, large triangular eye sockets, and sloped-up brows that meet together in the middle, lending them an appearance of permanent anguish. Because of the harsh environment of their homeworld, the Givins' organs are sealed against atmospheric exposure; thanks to this complex system, they can survive for about a day in a vacuum.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nIn order to survive their homeworld's lunar tides, the Givin became extremely adept at calculating the trajectory of their celestial bodies. Over the ages, Givin have become so skilled at celestial navigation that they are able to calculate hyperspace jumps in their heads. As such, mathematics have become a cornerstone of Givin society. Two Givin will often greet each other by exchanging complex equations for the other to solve.\r\n\r\nDue to their profound mathematical ability, Givin are skilled starship builders and astrogators. They create some of the most impressive, complex, and sleek ships in the galaxy. However, they frequently build their ships without the presence of a navcomputer or pressurization system, and so their buyers have to add these system in the starship aftermarket.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nGivin names are often derived by parents from favored mathematical equations. Male and female names do not significantly differ. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Daggibus, Lersia, Na-Soth, Nisil, Sladru\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Alarin, Nalas, Narth, Larr, Scoritoles\r\n\r\n### Givin Traits\r\nAs a Givin, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Givin reach adulthood in their early teens and live about 80 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Givins believe power and respect are earned rather than expected, causing them to tend towards balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Givin typically stand around 6 feet tall and weigh 150 lb. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Hardened Exterior.*** You have a tough, bony exterior. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n***Mathematical Savants.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check involving mathematics, you are considered to have expertise in the Technology skill.\r\n\r\n***Stargazer.*** You have proficiency in Piloting and Technology.\r\n\r\n***Vacuum Sealed.*** You can survive for one day within the vacuum of space. You still require oxygen to breathe. You have resistance to cold damage.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Givin. Givin is characterized by its use of mathematical jargon and symbols, making it nigh incomprehensible to the less mathematically inclined.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Gormak\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Green|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Orange or blue|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Frills on the face and body|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'2\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |100 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Voss|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Gormak|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe gormak are green humanoids with flat, noseless faces adorned with frills, collecting in whorls on the sides of their heads. They have clawed, three-fingered, frilled hands, and tend to possess a muscular build. Females are slightly shorter than males and lacked a whorl located above their nose. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nAn aggressive species, the gormak hold an innate love of warfare and competition, and are extremely hostile towards the other natives of their planet, the voss. The gormak hold a belief that in order for them to prosper, the voss, whom they view as a plague on the planet, must be destroyed. To achieve that goal, warriors have repeatedly assaulted the voss capital city over the course of centuries; however, despite their far greater numbers, their nature has kept them from uniting against their enemy. While their society and speech are considered primitive by galactic standards, their innate talent with technology rivals the top minds of the galaxy. From bits of scavenged electronics and equipment, the gormak construct advanced tools, heavy machinery, specialized weapons and even cybernetic implants. However, despite their incredible affinity for technology, the gormak remain a pre-spaceflight culture confined to their homeworld, which causes them to be viewed as a backward species despite being perfectly capable of repairing, modifying and improving tech created by more advanced cultures. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nGormak are commonly named after heroes of their history by local shamans. Surnames are tribe-based, but optional. \r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Damal, Henet, Wockuss, Yryu, Zenit\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Finay, Heidith, Jhekon, Rakva, Sanas\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** -Du, -Fo, -Qa, -Ry, -Ve\r\n\r\n### Gormak Traits\r\nAs a gormak, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Gormaks reach adulthood in their late teens and live for more than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Gormaks' warlike nature causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Gormaks typically stand 5 and a half to 6 and a half feet tall and generally weigh about 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Adaptive Resilience.*** Their innate understanding of technology allow gormak to readily adapt to its effects. You have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws against tech powers.\r\n\r\n***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.\r\n\r\n***Claws.*** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Technological Affinity.*** You have proficiency in the Technology skill, one vibroweapon and one blaster of your choice, and your choice of armstech's implements, biotech's implements, constructor's implements, mechanic's kits, or tinker's implements. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Technology) checks made to understand, utilize, or modify technology that you are unaware of or have never seen before.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Gormak. Gormak is primitive and gruff, often lacking definitions for things found outside of their homeworld. \r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Gotal\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Grey, brown, or black|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |White, grey, or brown|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Red, orange, yellow, grey, green, or black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Full body fur, flat noses, head cones|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'5\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |120 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Antar 4|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Antarian|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nGotals possess cranial horns as receptors to sense electromagnetism and other energy emissions. These nerve-ending filled cones can sense the natural electromagnetic fields produced by Antar 4's magnetite-rich crust, allowing the species to operate even in total darkness. Their senses also pick up the electromagnetic auras from other life forms. When close to their hunting targets, they can ascertain information on its mood, awareness, and state of mind. Electronic devices can also be sensed by Gotals; in fact, most droids give off enough electromagnetic emissions to at least annoy a Gotal, and at worst to seriously disorient the horned beings, making them notoriously distrustful of droids. Gotals rely heavily on their cones, with their eyesight and hearing being quite weak, and their sense of smell almost completely absent. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nSince their natural empathy makes them instantly sensitive to the feelings of others, Gotals have little use for government or laws on their homeworld, resulting in problems when dealing with other societies. No central authority figure can speak for Antar 4 as a whole in a crisis, and no organized Gotal military or police force can act on their behalf. Other species respect the Gotals for their discretion and restraint, but some individuals fear interacting with the horned beings for fear of having their emotional state revealed to others.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nGotal names are quite guttural, though there are also many harsher tones within their names. Gotal names do not vary significantly based on gender, and surnames are familial. \r\n\r\n**First Names.** Thon, Fern, Fuu'rash, Jir, Vluphol\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Gratlul, Klux, Vathon, Zilat, Krigh, Rahxem\r\n\r\n### Gotal Traits\r\nAs a Gotal, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Gotals reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Gotals' polite and respectful nature causes them to tend toward lawful alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Gotals typically stand 6 to 7 feet tall and generally weigh about 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Energy Sensors.*** Gotals perceive the environment around them through use of electromagnetic sensors held in their cranial horns. You have blindsight out to 30 feet. If another trait would grant you blindsight, the range is increased by half as many feet. \r\n\r\n***Hunter.*** You are proficient in Survival. \r\n\r\n***Natural Empathy.*** Gotal's electromagnetic sensors allow them to sense the emotions in those around them. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine emotions against humanoids and beasts within 10 feet of you.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Antarian. The Antarian language is characterized by growls and clicking noises at various volumes. \r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Gran\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Blue or tan|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Black, purple|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Three eyes and goat-like snout|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'10\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |115 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Kinyen|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Gran|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nGran can easily be identified by their three eyes and their goat-like snout. Female Gran also have three breasts. They have excellent vision, able to resolve more colors than most species, and even able to see into the infrared, thus they are able to sense one another's emotions and disposition by noting subtle changes in body heat and skin color. Gran have two stomachs, having evolved from herbivorous grazing animals who lived in herds on the mountains and highlands of Kinyen. A single meal can take almost an entire day to finish, after that a Gran does not often need to eat for several days.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe peaceful nature of Gran society is a reflection of their homeworld, Kinyen. Kinyen boasted large and rolling grasslands and highlands, a dense and beautiful forest, and one of the longest and clearest rivers in the Bes Ber Bikade sector. The beauty of this planet, and the need for primitive Gran to band together for defense against predatory animals, helped the Gran develop strong bonds of home and family in their society. \r\n\r\nThe Grans are also very protective of their families, and were some of the most devoted parents in the galaxy. This is because of their very powerful and sensitive sight, which can sense the emotions of their mates and their children. Gran society maintains its balance by setting up strict career quotas, and making sure young Gran are educated for a specific job that best served his or her talents.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nGran names typically are monosyllabic and accompanied by a surname, which is familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Ask, Dree, Ree, Pax, Nic\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Yan, Alijia, Meeb, Sir, Zeek\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Moe, Leem, Yees, Wix, Naaq\r\n\r\n### Gran Traits\r\nAs a Gran, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Gran reach adulthood around their late teens and live up to 80 years. \r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Gran highly organized society cause them to tend toward lawful alignments, though there are exceptions..\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Gran typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh around 170 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Slow Metabolism.*** You are able to go a number of days without food equal to 3 + twice your Constitution modifier before suffering exhaustion.\r\n\r\n***Keen Sight.*** Through use of infrared vision, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. \r\n\r\n***Reader of Hearts.*** Through identifying subtle variations in a target's body heat, the Gran are able to better understand their emotions and intentions. You are proficient in the Insight skill. \r\n\r\n***Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Gran. It is rare to hear Gran spoken on any world other than Kinyen.\r\n\r\n___\r\n___\r\n> ## Half-human\r\n> |||\r\n> |:--:|:--:|\r\n> |Abyssin|Savage Attacks|\r\n> |Advosze|Darkvision|\r\n> |Aing-Tii|Armored Plates|\r\n> |Aleena|Racer's Reflexes|\r\n> |Anomid|Tech Resistance|\r\n> |Anx|Acute Smell|\r\n> |Aqualish|Darkvision|\r\n> |Arcona|Keen Smell|\r\n> |Ardennian|Darkvision|\r\n> |Arkanian|Darkvision Infrared Sight Sunlight Sensitivity|\r\n> |Barabel|Darkvision|\r\n> |Baragwin|Keen Smell|\r\n> |Besalisk|Powerful Build|\r\n> |Bith|Detail Oriented|\r\n> |Bothan|Naturally Stealth|\r\n> |Caamasi|Keen Smell|\r\n> |Cathar|Leonine Agility|\r\n> |Cerean|Closed Mind|\r\n> |Chadra-Fan|Second Heart|\r\n> |Chagrian|Darkvision|\r\n> |Chevin|Keen Hearing|\r\n> |Chiss|Darkvision|\r\n> |Clawdite|Unsettling Visage|\r\n> |Codru-Ji|Keen Hearing|\r\n> |Dashade|Force Contention|\r\n> |Defel|Hidden Step|\r\n> |Devaronian|Two Livered|\r\n> |Diathim|Luminescent Aura|\r\n> |Dowutin|Hide|\r\n> |Draethos|Darkvision|\r\n> |Dug|Fury of the Small|\r\n> |Duros|Darkvision|\r\n> |Echani|Combative Culture|\r\n> |Esh-Kha|Darkvision|\r\n> |Ewok|Mask of the Wild|\r\n> |Falleen|Closed Mind|\r\n> |Flesh Raider|Darkvision|\r\n> |Gamorrean|Savage Attacks|\r\n> |Gand|Lungless|\r\n> |Gank|Aggressive|\r\n> |Geonosian|Geonosian Weaponry|\r\n> |Givin|Vacuum Sealed|\r\n> |||\r\n> |:--:|:--:|\r\n> |Gormak|Adaptive Resilience|\r\n> |Gotal|Natural Empathy|\r\n> |Gran|Keen Sight|\r\n> |Gungan|Martial Proficiency|\r\n> |Harch|Venomous Fangs|\r\n> |Herglic|Toughness|\r\n> |Ho'Din|Second Heart|\r\n> |Houk|Toughness|\r\n> |Iktotchi|Precognition|\r\n> |Ithorian|Hold Breath|\r\n> |Jawa|Grovel, Cower, and Beg|\r\n> |Kage|Superior Darkvision|\r\n> |Kaleesh|Darkvision|\r\n> |Kalloran|Keen Hearing|\r\n> |Kaminoan|Geneticist Ultraviolet Sight|\r\n> |Karkarodon|Aggressive|\r\n> |Kel Dor|Darkvision|\r\n> |Kiffar|Nimble Reflexes|\r\n> |Killik|Carapace|\r\n> |Klatooinian|Wisdom of the Elders|\r\n> |Kubaz|Darkvision|\r\n> |Kushiban|Grovel, Cower, and Beg|\r\n> |Kyuzo|Darkvision|\r\n> |Lannik|Closed Mind|\r\n> |Lasat|Powerful Build|\r\n> |Lurmen|Rolling Agility|\r\n> |Massassi|Darkvision|\r\n> |Mikkian|Keen Hearing|\r\n> |Miraluka|Force Sight|\r\n> |Mirialan|Spiritual|\r\n> |Mon Calamari|Darkvision|\r\n> |Mustafarian|Darkvision|\r\n> |Muun|Second Heart|\r\n> |Nautolan|Darkvision|\r\n> |Neimoidian|Darkvision|\r\n> |Nikto|Adaptation|\r\n> |Noghri|Keen Smell|\r\n> |Nothoiin|Heightened Reflexes|\r\n> |Ortolan|Grovel, Cower, and Beg|\r\n> |Quarren|Keen Hearing|\r\n> |Pa'lowick|Hold Breath Snout|\r\n> |Pantoran|Cold Adaptation|\r\n> |||\r\n> |:--:|:--:|\r\n> |Patrolian|Darkvision|\r\n> |Pau'an|Darkvision|\r\n> |Pyke|Mercantile Notorious Slavers|\r\n> |Quermian|Two Brains|\r\n> |Rakata|Darkvision|\r\n> |Rattataki|Surprise Attack|\r\n> |Rishii|Keen Hearing and Sight|\r\n> |Rodian|Darkvision|\r\n> |Ryn|Darkvision|\r\n> |Selkath|Venomous Claws|\r\n> |Selonian|Darkvision|\r\n> |Shistavanen|Darkvision Forced March|\r\n> |Ssi Ruu|Keen Smell Sunlight Sensitivity Tooth and Nail|\r\n> |Sith|Darkvision|\r\n> |Squib|Keen Smell|\r\n> |Sullustan|Darkvision|\r\n> |Talz|Darkvision|\r\n> |Tarasin|Sa'tosin Sense|\r\n> |Taung|Toughness Force-Insensitive|\r\n> |Theelin|Mutation|\r\n> |Thisspiasian|Prehensile Tail|\r\n> |Tiss'shar|Darkvision|\r\n> |Tognath|Hide|\r\n> |Togorian|Toughness|\r\n> |Togruta|Darkvision|\r\n> |Toydarian|Closed Mind|\r\n> |Trandoshan|Saving Face|\r\n> |Tusken|Aggressive|\r\n> |Twi'lek|Darkvision|\r\n> |Ugnaught|Darkvision|\r\n> |Umbaran|Darkvision|\r\n> |Verpine|Hardened Carapace|\r\n> |Voss|Darkvision|\r\n> |Vurk|Darkvision|\r\n> |Weequay|Darkvision|\r\n> |Wookiee|Darkvision|\r\n> |Xexto|Split Mind|\r\n> |Yevetha|Aggressive|\r\n> |Zabrak|Darkvision|\r\n> |Zeltron|Two Livered|\r\n> |Zygerrian|Darkvision|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe appearance and biological features of half-humans vary drastically by each species, but tend to fall somewhere in the middle. A common side-effect of a species interbreeding with humans is the loss of darkvision and tails.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nHalf-humans are subjects of two separate cultures, but belong in neither. A half-human might be raised amongst humans or their other half, or might be fully ostracized, instead growing up in a remote, isolated place, removed from both species.\r\n\r\n> #### Traits\r\n> Half-humans gain the ***Defiant*** special trait from their human half. They also gain the special traits from their non-human half, except for those trait(s) mentioned in the Half-Human table above.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nHalf-human names might follow human conventions, or that of the other half. Often, they blend the two in some fashion, perhaps taking a human surname, with a special name.\r\n\r\n### Half-human Traits\r\nAs a half-human, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Half-humans gain the ability score increases of their non-human half, but they can choose any ability score for one of the options, instead of the given option. Half-humans can not increase the same ability score twice during character creation using this feature.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Half-humans live around the average of the two species' lifespans.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Half-humans tend towards their non-human half's alignment.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Half-humans stand and weigh around the average of the two species' height and weight. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is the size of your non-human half.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is that of your non-human half.\r\n\r\n***Defiant.*** Half-humans are known to be stubborn and often refuse to give up, even against the worst odds. When you or a creature you can see that can see and understand you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can roll a d4 and add it to their roll (no action required). You can use this before or after the roll, but before the GM determines the roll's outcome. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, regardless of whether or not the non-human half can speak it, and the language(s) associated with your non-human half.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Harch\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Pale pink|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Brown, black|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Red|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Spider-like with six eyes, eight limbs and chelicerae|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'5\"|+2d8\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |150 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Secundus Ando|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Harchese|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe Harch possess a large-fanged mouth between two prominent chelicerae, above which they have six red eyes arranged in a semicircle. The two lowest eyes are larger and roughly twice the size of the four smaller eyes. Harch walk on two legs and have six arms, with the second and third set of arm protruding from behind the first pair rather than directly above or below them. These arms are covered in thick hair and end in three-fingered hands.\r\n\r\nThe Harch are distantly related to the Aqualish species and there is much debate among geneticists regarding the relationship between the Harch and the Aqualish Ualaq subspecies. However, the Harch themselves considered such discussions to be obscene.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nNot much is known about the Harch, as few of them have mingled with the galactic community, preferring to stay on Secundus Ando. Harch that leave the planet tend to have a more aspirant nature than their fellows, and often reach great heights in their chosen professions in the galaxy. Such Harch are considered outliers\ufffdmost apparently care little for titles.\r\n\r\nLike the Arcona species, female Harch are seen as more domineering and aggressive than their male counterparts. It is not unheard of for a male Harch to raise entire broods of hatchlings alone.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nHarch names are not gender-specific. Harch do not use surnames.\r\n\r\n**Names.** Cubach, Quixoch, Trench, Turch\r\n\r\n### Harch Traits\r\nAs a Harch, you have the following special traits:\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength, Constitution, and Intelligence scores increase by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Harch reach adulthood at age 10 and can live up to 200 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Harch are cold, calculating beings, causing them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Harch stand around 6 feet tall and weigh between 200 and 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Bite.*** Your fangs are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage. Lastly, as a bonus action, you can perform a special bite attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of its next turn, and you can't use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Six-Armed.*** Harch have six arms which they can use independently of one another.

They are tall and wide, and have smooth, hairless skin that ranged in color from pale blue to black, though some rare individuals may appear pink or have white markings on their sides. Their girth tends to leave them feeling out of place among smaller species; herglic tend to take up two chairs or fill the entire doorway of any establishment they enter that does not cater to beings their size.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe herglics are very technologically advanced, developing space flight and hyperdrives and colonizing their sector of the galaxy prior to the formation of the Galactic Republic. Natural explorers and traders, they sailed the cosmos establishing crucial trade routes and gaining prestige. Despite their size, herglic are surprisingly dexterous while working with tools, and are some of the finest engineers in the galaxy. \r\n\r\nHerglics have an inquisitive but practical nature, enjoying travel and having exotic experiences. Their perpetually calm demeanor  helps them interact with most other species peacefully, though when dealing with smaller species, herglics tend to become nervous and self-conscious about their proportions. They also seem to have an innate predilection for gambling and games of chance, which have gotten more than one herglic into trouble on several occasions.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nMale names are typically harsher sounding than female names. Herglics rarely use surnames.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Biglu, Melchi, Sehvorah\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Mahg-Raet, Seese, Uddn\r\n\r\n### Herglic Traits\r\nAs a herglic, you have the following special traits:\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Herglic reach adulthood in their late teens and live up to 120 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Herglics' gentle nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Herglic stand between 6 and 8 feet tall and weigh up to 600 lbs.

Ho'dins are, on average, over nine feet tall\ufffdnearly a full head taller than wookiees. Renowned throughout the galaxy as botanists and healers, the ho'din claim an ancestry derived from the plants of their home planet, Moltok\ufffdin fact, \"ho'din\" translates as \"walking flower\" in Galactic Basic. They are, in fact, reptilian, as their natural climbing skills and cold-bloodedness seem to indicate, and boast a second heart to enhance their survivability. Their \"snake hair\" is temperature-sensitive, allowing ho'din to sense changes in ambient temperature.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nHo'dins are known to be self-conscious and vain, particularly when it comes to their looks and their work, and do not take criticism or insults well. Their religion, Dinante Fli'R, is centered around worshipping and communing with nature, a trait that has sent many ho'din out into the galaxy to rejuvenate damaged planets. The ho'din have an aversion to technology and avoid surface mining and manufacturing, opting instead to dwell in trees. They have learned to make incredibly advanced pharmaceuticals and gardens using their botanical skills to concoct natural medicines, some of which have cured plagues on distant worlds. The title of \"Master Gardener\" is one of high esteem and great respect in ho'din society.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nHo'din names are quite diverse.

They are very powerful due to their large bulk of pure muscle. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe houk have well-earned reputations as bullies, cheaters, and backstabbers. They are often compared to wookiees because of their great strength and violent disposition. Houk are humorless, short-tempered beings who use their strength to antagonize weaker beings. Their propensity for deceit and skulduggery is matched only by the hutts. Though their tempers are not as explosive as those of wookiees, houk are known for their tendency to solve problems violently. In politics, they will often wage war without formal declarations, negotiate in bad faith, and ignore treaties. Though this preference for violence tend to cause the houk problems in dealing with other societies, it often gets them what they want. Surprisingly though, in personal combat, houk prefer to use stealth rather than direct confrontation. This gives them a reputation for deceit and cowardice. However, just as each houk colony has a different culture and government, houk individuals have varied personalities. Though all houk come from a culture with high levels of corruption and violence, many houk are hard workers who have learned to get along with other sentients. The houk produce little technology of their own, though they adapt themselves to the standard technology of the rest of the galaxy. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nHouk names are gruff and primitive in nature, and don't vary by gender.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Agamor, Krelba, Morg, Roath\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Krin, Nar, Vogog, Voss\r\n\r\n### Houk Traits\r\nAs a houk, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Houk reach adulthood in their late teens and live for about 80 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Most houk are short-tempered and deceitful, causing them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Houk typically stand 6 to 8 feet tall and generally weigh about 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Ambusher.*** You have proficiency in the Stealth skill. \r\n\r\n***Powerful Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles.

You can use this trait only once per combat.\r\n\r\n***Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Houkese. Houkese is mainly formed by grunts, with subtle tonal inflections to differentiate words that would otherwise sound the same. Written Houkese uses primitive ideograms with one letter to represent each simple verb, and complex pictograms to represent nouns. \r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Hutt, Adolescent\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Black, blue, brown, gold, green, purple, tan, white, or yellow|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None |\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Blue, gray, green, orange, turquoise, violet, or yellow|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  | Three lungs, slug-like appearance|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  | 5'5\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  | 400 lb.|x(2d8) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  | Nal Hutta|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Huttese|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nHutts are a massive slug-like species who have large mouths and stubby arms. They have three lungs and thick leathery skin, which is wrinkled and slimy. Hutts often have watery eyes and lack facial expressions.  Their tails are supported by a skeletal spine.  Despite their legendary size, hutts start out as tiny huttlets less than half a foot in height, and continually grow over the long lives.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nMost hutts are crime lords who live opulent lives overseeing criminal underworld activities like spice smuggling, slavery, gambling and bounty hunting. This is not true for all, however, as some eschew the life of a decadent, obese version of their species and prefer a more mobile existence. Hutt society is divided into families known as kajidics, a social structure that is both familial and a crime gang.\r\n\r\nHutts are encouraged to make a name for themselves around the age of 150 while simultaneously not threatening the welfare of the clan.  At around 200, they will likely stop being saved by the clan and encouraged even further to fend for themselves while benefiting the kajidic; they may even be granted a star system or two.  Nomadic or kajidic-less hutts are often hunted or killed by other hutts in fear of the nomad coming to claim a territory.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nHutt names with a suffix title as \"the Hutt\" are usually reserved for noteworthy huts, with the name of a hutt's kajidic coming before the title.  Because hutts are hermaphroditic, choosing a gender at will, their names are considered androgynous.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Arok, Gorga, Jabba, Mama, Ziro, \r\n\r\n**Kajidic Names.** Besadii, Desilijic, Fenn'ak, Gnuda\r\n\r\n### Hutt Traits\r\nAs a hutt you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Hutts are considered a child until around the age of 200 in which they are a full fledged adult.  Hutts can live upwards of 900 years with even more ancient ones exceeding that.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Hutts are selfish, greedy, and highly organized, causing them to tend toward chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Hutts have a unique special characteristic; from birth to death, they never stop growing. As an adolescent hutt, you typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh at least 400 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 20 feet.\r\n\r\n***Closed Mind.*** Hutt brains have an unusual composition which made them resistant to influence from the Force.

Hutts rarely speak Galactic Basic, even though they are perfectly able; if the person with whom they are speaking doesn't understand Huttese, they are more likely to use an interpretor than deign to speak the language of lesser species.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Iktotchi\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Pink|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Horns, precognition, telepathy, thick pink skin|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|4'11\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|120 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Iktotch, moon of Iktotchon|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Iktotchese|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nIktotchi do not have hair, but rather they had a very resistant skin which protected them from the violent winds which crossed the satellite.

Upward mobility is both possible and encouraged. Iktotchi are an outwardly dispassionate people, which is evidenced by their culture. They have a robust legal system, and suffer little crime. Iktotchi are respectful of cultures other than their own and can easily integrate with others.\r\n\r\nIktotchi who distinguish themselves often earn a titular nickname, by which they are referred to in place of their name. Generally, this is done by accomplishing a remarkable feat that benefits the Iktotchi as whole.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nIktotchi names are generally two syllables. Surnames are familial.

Kallerans are tall and flexible; their hands and feet have three prehensile digits on each, which leeds kallerans to avoid wearing shoes or boots. The majority of kallerans have green skin patterned with distinctive black stripes. The species have dense muscles that assist them in the protection of their otherwise delicate bodies. The kalleran head is distinguished by fin-like folds on the tops and sides of their faces. These fins augment a kalleran's hearing, allowing sound to bounce back and be picked up by the two antenna crowning their head. These antenna are sensory organs that serve as olfactory and aural receptors. Kallerans have lungs adapted to breathe above water, though the majority of their respiration is done through their skin. A holdover from their amphibious past, their skin can draw oxygen in from the air and filter out carbon dioxide. Their respiratory system requires them to consume more water than other species their size to keep their skin moist and supple. Because they do not primarily breathe through their mouths, kallerans did not evolve noses.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nAbove all else, kalleran's value personal achievement over collective accomplishments. Because of this, the people of Kaller have never united to form great societies or participate in galactic affairs. Much of the cultural expansion on Kaller was brought by colonists, both friendly and violent, who had settled the world over the course of millennia.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nKallerans have regal sounding names, sometimes using accents on vowels, with clan-based surnames. \r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Gliconn, Orcas, L\ufffdvern, Seelv\ufffdn\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Cybele, F\ufffdress, Numarin, Retesh\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Alash, Byssus, Estair, Lash\r\n\r\n### Kalleran Traits\r\nAs a kalleran, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Kallerans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Kallerans' individualistic society causes them to tend towards chaotic alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Kallerans typically stand 6 and a half to 8 feet tall and generally weigh about 150 lbs.

The almond-shaped eyes of kaminoans are also able to see color in the ultraviolet spectrum. While female kaminoans are bald, males possess headcrests and fin ridges along the rear of their small, bulbous skulls.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe kaminoans see themselves as a superior form of life, but nevertheless remained polite to outsiders. To them any species seeking self-improvement is worthy of respect, but those who do not are obviously inferior; self-improvement has a central role in Kaminoan society. Through the development and mastery of selective breeding, genetics, and cloning, the kaminoans were able to overcome a cataclysm that pushed them to the brink of extinction. \r\n\r\nKaminoans live in a caste based society, determined by the color of the kaminoan's eyes. Gray eyed individuals handle administration and are considered of the highest-level caste; middle castes had yellow eyes and handle the skilled work; and lower castes had blue eyes and perform manual labor and other menial tasks. Although it is extremely rare, kaminoans are sometimes born with green eyes. Those are viewed as genetically inferior and as a threat to the kaminoans' well ordered society and as such are exterminated shortly after birth. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nKaminoan names typically are composed by around two syllables and a brief surname.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Lama, Ni, Orun, Koa\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Taun, Ko, Nala, Kina\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Ha, Su, We, Sai, Wa\r\n\r\n### Kaminoan Traits\r\nAs a kaminoan, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Kaminoans reach adulthood at 11 years old and live around 100 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Kaminoans highly organized society lead individuals to tend toward a lawful alignment, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.***  Kaminoans typically stand 7 to 8 feet tall and weigh around 150 lbs.

Clans often fight eachother for dominance, natural resources, and to cull the weak. Each clan on the planet has a ruling triumvirate, usually comprised of venerated warriors who rule for life. When a younger Karkarodon wants to replace one of the ruling body, they challenge them to single, mortal combat. Occasionally, the challenged may spare the life of the challenger when they win, though that usually leads to resentment from the loser.\r\n\r\nKarkarodons do not believe in lying or duplicity. They believe in approaching problems head on and saying what they mean, and are generally demeaing towards those they deem their lessers.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nKarkarodon names are harsh and gutteral.

They effectively become another vessel of the hive mind.\r\n\r\nKilliks lose connection to their hive mind at great distances. Those who voluntarily leave the hive mind are referred to as Leavers. It is rare that they are allowed to rejoin their hive without reason.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nKilliks are a hive-mind insectoid that typically don't use names.

They are also notable for their heavy brows and ridges along the tops of their heads. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nFor centuries, klatooinians have been slaves to the hutts, whom they view as almost godlike, immortal beings. Although the hutts allow a council of elders to rule on Klatooine, all off-world affairs are wholly under hutt control. Under the hutts, the klatooinians serve as soldiers and guards. Even those klatooinians who do not serve the hutts are often employed as hired muscle by other masters.\r\n\r\nKlatooinian society was known for a strong belief in tradition and the wisdom of the elders, although some younger klatooinians rebelled against this norm and sought out freedom from enslavement. Others attempted to gain their own fortunes as smugglers, pirates, bounty hunters, or raiders.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nKlatooinian names are often derived from the names of great heroes and historical figures.

They have adapted to their sun-scorched, vegetation-deprived world by learning to survive off their world's native insect population. Filled with two rows of teeth for gnashing their food, the Kubaz trunk also functions as a highly sensitive nose.  Due to living on their homeworld of Kubindi\ufffda planet which orbits a blue star\ufffdKubaz are highly sensitive to red wavelengths; when traveling to planets with a red or yellow star, Kubaz are forced to don protective eyewear to avoid damaging their sensitive eyes.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe Kubazi society is based on a clan structure which dwell in underground nests. Ruled by a queen, each clan takes the name of their queen they are descended from. Developing a non-verbal language of hand gestures which indicated their intentions, Kubaz are able to speak Galactic Basic, though with a strong nasally accent.  When interacting with other species, some Kubaz will share certain hand signals with non-Kubaz in order to ease communications.  Obsessed with tact and decorum, the Kubaz place a high emphasis on the family unit and proper courtesies, displaying truthfulness to a fault. Valuing art and literature with such vigor as to sometimes practice smuggling of great works, the Kubaz do not find such pursuits to be wrong or unlawful.  Due to their diet on Kubindi, the Kubaz have poor relations with sentient insectile species. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nKubaz names are usually dominated by harsher sounds, but some names lean more melodic. Surnames are clan-based.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Shaf, Rizor, Duldril, Kurn, Schnaldiz\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Zhanro, Dizi, Tavo, Agoz, Nuzrem\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Re, Eadzan, Hai, Khu'nar, Mairvuc, Va\r\n\r\n### Kubaz Traits\r\nAs a Kubaz, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Kubaz reach adulthood in their early teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Kubaz' courteous nature causes them to tend toward lawful alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Kubaz typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh around 160 lbs.

They are diminutive, unimposing, and typically weaker than most humanoids, but they are also quite difficult to track due to their natural speed and stealth.\r\n\r\nWhile Kushibans are quadrupeds, their forepaws are as manipulative as traditional hands. While kushibans can walk on two legs, they typically run around on four feet since they can move significantly faster that way. \r\n\r\nKushibans are inherently cute and fuzzy, and more nefarious species often attempt to take them as slaves. Kushibans are social and do not take well to slavery, and they typically don't live long in solitude or captivity. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nKushibans live in a simple, peaceful society on the non-industrialized, lush green planet of Kushibah in the Outer Rim. Kushibans are typically kind and generous, with a playful sense of humor and a penchant for practical jokes. However, if betrayed or angered, Kushibans can be cruel or vindictive, and they have little patience for bullies, simpletons, and misanthropes.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nKushiban names are a single word combining both their first and familial names.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Cerlyk, Etyk, Mabbik, Tieko, Widdimur\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Asani, Pritsi, Sibble, Mirax\r\n\r\n### Kushiban Traits\r\nAs a Kushiban, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Kushibans reach adulthood at 13 and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Kushibans' playful nature causes them to tend toward chaotic light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Kushibans typically stand 3 and a half to 4 feet tall and weigh around 40 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Grovel, Cower, and Beg.*** As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\r\n\r\n***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.\r\n\r\n***Nimble Agility.*** Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn.

Kushiban has a bubbly, joyful tone to it.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Kyuzo\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Green, ranging from lighter olive shades to deep blue-green colors|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Yellow|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Compound or slit-pupiled eyes, dense musculature, suffer from respiratory and vision problems in standard gravity environments|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|5'9\"|+2d8\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|140 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Phatrong|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Kyuzo|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nA lanky, bipedal humanoid species, the Kyuzo originate on the gravity-heavy Outer Rim world of Phatrong. Kyuzo are tall and slender, though their appearance belies their strength and quickness. Due to the uncommon makeup of their homeworld's atmosphere, Kyuzo frequently wear corrective lenses and a highly pressurized filter mask over their faces to protect their sensitive respiratory systems and assist them in coping with uncomfortable climates like galactic standard habitable environments. As well as causing respiratory and vision problems, exposure to such conditions causes a Kyuzo to become ill within in a short period of time, interfering with their ability to concentrate and slowing them down.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nA species known for its strong sense of justice and honor, most Kyuzo regard oaths and contracts as unbreakable and many species seek them as mercenaries, law-enforcement personnel and bounty hunters. A highly political species, the Kyuzo developed societies that span considerable geographical areas, and most identify as members of a particular country or region. Most major islands and continents on Phatrong are their own political units, though they do form a loose confederacy.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nMale names typically end in vowels, while female names end in consonants. Surnames are based on region.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Drego, Embo, Khalu, Mhali, Zuvio\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Catras, Garing, Streehn, Turung\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Brihney, Ghall, Khambey, Maway, Vori\r\n\r\n### Kyuzo Traits\r\nAs a Kyuzo, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Kyuzo reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Kyuzos' belief in justice and honor cause them to tend toward lawful balanced, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Kyuzo typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 170 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** Your natural evolution allows you to see what others do not in dim and dark conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Foreign Biology.*** Kyuzo struggle in atmospheres other than those of Phatrong. You wear a filter mask, and if your mask is removed while you are in such an environment, you lose consciousness.\r\n\r\n***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.\r\n\r\n***Strong-Legged.*** When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Kyuzo. Kyuzo is characterized by short words and quick phrases.

Males and females are equally tall, although the latter have a considerably less strong complexity. Their species is, however, much more vigorous and resistant than what its size could suggest. A Lannik's skin tends to be of colours similar to his or her eyes and hair. The species has evolved long pointy ears which allow them to hear better than human ears. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe Lannik culture is apparently war loving, and Lanniks feel a great respect for warriors. At the same time, though, they follow a strict centuries-old code of honour. Lannik soldiers have the custom of tying all their hair in a single topknot over their head. Their species is one of fierce warriors, whose abilities have developed fighting against terrible predators and other Lanniks in a long history of wars. Although many regard the Lannik as hotheaded and temperamental, they are quite fearless and clear-headed even in combat, giving them the ability to think their way out of a dangerous situation.\r\n\r\nThe Lannik do not show their thoughts through their facial expressions, and seem always angry to other species. They are also very stubborn, and are not likely to change career once they chose it. Most males - and many females - serve in the planetary militia, celebrating the species' past as a warrior species. Some take on off-world mercenary work.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nLannik names are generally short. Lanniks don't often give out their surnames.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Minch, Oteg, Vandar, Yaddle, Yoda\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Giro, Lina, Penny, Vona, Zeya\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Bek, Kaz, Mon, Var, Zin\r\n\r\n### Lannik Traits\r\nAs a lannik, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Lanniks reach adulthood in their 100's and can live up to 900 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Despite the turbulence on their homeworld, Lanniks tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Lanniks typically stand 3 to 4 feet tall and rarely weigh more than 50 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Closed Mind.*** Lanniks have a natural attunement for the Force, which makes them resistant to its powers. You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.\r\n\r\n***Force-Sensitive.*** You know the *guidance* at-will force power. When you reach 3rd level, you learn and can cast the *valor* force power once per day. When you reach 5th level, you learn and can cast the *force enlightenment* force power once per day. Wisdom is your forcecasting ability for these powers.\r\n\r\n***Keen Hearing.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.\r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields. Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.\r\n\r\n***Wisdom of the Elders.*** You are proficient in the Lore skill.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Lannik. Due to their large ears, the Lannik language is spoken softly, and it is considered insulting to shout.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Lasat\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Grey or purple|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Purple or grey (with age)|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Green|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Impressive height, strength, and agility|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|6'0\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|160 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Lira San|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Lasat|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nA humanoid sentient species, Lasats are notable for their impressive height, strength, and agility, with their muscular digitigrade legs enabling them to run faster, jump higher and farther, and move more quietly than humans. Their large finger pads and prehensile toes assist them in climbing. In addition, their large eyes and ears afford them superior sight and hearing over humans. They had the strength to open a powered-down blast door. A height of two meters tall was considered below-average for a Lasat.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nLasat society is held together by a long-standing oral tradition, featuring clever and stealthy heroes. Within the species, those with fighting skills are highly respected, often being members of the Lasan High Honor Guard, a group of highly trained, highly intelligent warriors sworn to protect their homeworld of Lira San. Bo-rifles are a long-standing tradition in Lasat culture, used exclusively by the Honor Guard of Lasan. The warrior way of the Lasat is the Boosahn Keeraw. When a Lasat is bested by a superior opponent in combat, they would give them their weapon.\r\n\r\nFacial hair is an important status symbol in Lasat culture. Those with green eyes and prominent purple stripes are considered to be attractive by others of their species. Juvenile Lasat are noted to climb tree branches. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nLasat names tend to be melodic, with the occasionally harsh tone sprinkled in. Surnames are born by communities within Lasat culture rather than individual families.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Brob, Drim, Krus, Parred, Volares\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Denazo, Gume, Hado, Zanisa\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Dragarr, Ellias, Krod, Roleb, Vuzan \r\n\r\n### Lasat Traits\r\nAs a lasat, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Lasats reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Lasat' honorable tendences cause them to tend toward lawful light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Lasats tower over other species, averaging 7 feet tall and weighing over 200 lbs.

They can walk either upright on their two legs, and can also use their arms and legs for faster movement. Many lurmen have the ability to roll themselves into a wheeled shape; this allows them to cover distances at great speed. They may have learned this ability from the native amani on Maridun. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe lurmen use fallen seedpods from the giant trees as shelter and home. Living near the trees proves too dangerous, as the falling pods can be deadly. Instead, the lurmen drag the pods into a clearing and use them as huts. They also extract essential oils from the pods for nutrition and healing medicines. Most lurmen are pacifistic by nature and refuse to fight or run even in the face of death. They often will hide instead of using violence. As pacifists, they carry no weapons but carry farming tools or ropes. The greatest native threat to the lurmen are the amani and the mastiff phalones, raptor-headed quadrupeds that hunted in groups. However, even in defeating these beasts the lurmen attempt to remain true to their pacifist ideals, and not inflict any injury to the creatures. Instead, when cornered by a mastiff phalone, an agile lurmen will try to unbalance the creature by tying a rope around its stout legs. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nLurmen names are sharp and made up of a single syllable. Instead of surnames, lurmen are granted additional names based on their importance to the village. Common lurmen possess one name, with leaders having as many as four. \r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Fee, Gatt, Nub, Shoo, Yup\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Kal, Laa, Shal, Vook, Yiit\r\n\r\n### Lurmen Traits\r\nAs a lurmen, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Lurmen reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than 80 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** The pacifistic nature of the lurmen causes them to be neutral light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Lurmen typically stand around 3 feet tall and generally weigh about 45 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Natural Healer.*** You have proficiency in the Medicine and Nature skills, and the bioanalysis kit.\r\n\r\n***Prehensile Tail and Feet.*** You have supreme control over your tail and feet and can use them to manipulate objects as well as your hands. \r\n\r\n***Rolling Agility.*** As a lurmen, you can run on all fours, or curl into a ball, to move quickly along the ground. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns. \r\n\r\n***Treeclimber.*** You have a climbing speed of 25 feet. You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing. \r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons.

Lurmese is a name collectively given to the various tribal languages spoken by the lurmen people. While each language is distinct, shared phrases allow translation between dialects. \r\n\r\n___\r\n> ##  Massassi\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n> |:---|:--:|:-----------|\r\n> |  ***Skin Color***  | | Crimson |\r\n> |  ***Hair Color***  | | None |\r\n> |  ***Eye Color***  | | Glowing white or yellow |\r\n> |  ***Distinctions***  | | Sharp predatory features, fin-like growths, cheek tendrils, tall stature |\r\n>___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n> |:---|:--:|:-----------:|:---:|\r\n> |  *Height*  | 6'10\" | +2d8\" |\r\n> |  *Weight*  | 80 lb. | x(2d4) lb. |\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n> |:---|:--:|:-----------|\r\n> |  *Homeworld* | | Korriban, Yavin 4 (adopted) |\r\n> |  *Language*  | | Sith |\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe warrior caste of the sith purebloods, the massassi have genetically turned into the perfect warrior. While some looked like their sith pureblood brothers, others have more extreme physical differences, including fin-like growths, a taller form and tough skin. These imposing figures live much shorter lives than other species. They, like the few other creatures that inhabit Korriban, derive sustenance directly from the dark side of the Force, in part of a natural symbiotic relationship where sith\ufffdlike the massassi\ufffdfeed on the dark side, and empower it in turn. Thus the massassi have such a high rate of Force-sensitivity that they are considered a naturally Force-sensitive species.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe massassi are fearsome, ruthless, and efficient soldiers. As with the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity for the massassi. They are not only fearsome, but both loyal and formidable warriors that are dedicated to their sith masters. Though they engage in supposedly primitive practices such as sacrifice and hold a strong caste system, their civilization is quite sophisticated. In addition to the focus on war and fighting, the massassi are also loyal and organized. Even though they are not extremely intelligent, they can be trained to carry out complex battle plans and maintain their equipment, starships, and weaponry.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nOriginating from the pureblood sith, massassi abominations follow many similiar naming conventions. Their names represent primitive virtues in the Sith tongue, and have no surname. \r\n\r\n**Males Names.** Asha, Derriphan, H\ufffdsk, Jen, \r\n \r\n**Female Names.** Kintik, Midwan, Siqsa, Ty\ufffdk\r\n\r\n### Massassi Traits\r\nAs a massassi, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution increases by 2, and your Strength increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Massassi live relatively short lives. They reach adulthood after 14 years, and reach old age around 40 years of life.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** The massassi are savage and brutish warriors who relish on the violence of combat, usually following a dark and chaotic nature.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Massassi are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 200 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Type.*** Your creature type is both aberration and humanoid.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\ufffdt discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Force Symbiosis.*** When you reach 3rd level, you can cast your choice of the *curse*, *dun moch*, or *hex* force power once per day. Your forcecasting ability is Charisma.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n***Oversized.*** Lightweapons and vibroweapons that lack the dexterity or light property are considered to have the heavy property for you. The strength number for blasters is reduced by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11).

The mikkians' most distinctive feature are their motile head-tendrils, with the number, form, and pattern varying between individuals. These head-tendrils primarily serve as sensory organs, particularly detecting sound as a replacement for an ear common in other species. Mikkian head-tendrils also could detect other information, such as humidity, temperature, magnetic direction and radiation. This radiation detection can be detected to the extent that mikkians can \"see\" light and dark, although their eyes are still their primary visual organs. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nMikkians place kinship and integrity above all. In fact, their honesty can come across as blunt or even rude to other sentients. Conversely, mikkians often have trouble adjusting to the more flexible views of other races. Their complex code of honor encompass all things in life, with a particular insistance on matters of warfare. Although they respect warrior traditions, the Mikkians nevertheless value discipline and honor over victory or physical might.\r\n\r\nDifferent religious traditions exist among the Mikkians, but belief in the Force plays a central role in all of them. In Mikkian society, their head-tendrils have important cultural significance, and as such tendril-reading is used by Mikkian mystics to predict their future. Every facet of the head-tendril contributes to that meaning.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nMikkian names are often short and disyllabic, with a melodic quality to them. Mikkians typically don't use surnames, though some may adopt them. \r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Cage, Fedlas, Mekko, Sakas \r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Beyra, Fenvar, Tiplee, Zelna \r\n\r\n### Mikkian Traits\r\nAs a mikkian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Mikkian reach adulthood in their late teens and live a little over a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Mikkian's honor and integrity based culture causes them to tend toward lawful alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Mikkian typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 120 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Blindsight.*** Mikkian can perceive the world around them through heat and radiation. You have blindsight out to 30 feet.

This vision is so strong that if a Miraluka looks upon a Jedi or Sith, they can \"see\" Force radiating off them. The strength of a Miraluka's connection to the Force varies by individual.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nMiraluka are a thoughtful, cautious, and deliberative species. They have little interest in personal gain or glory. For social reasons, Miraluka hide their appearance by wearing a headband, a mask, or similar concealing headwear. In addition all Miraluka are very united by species. They call themselves \"brothers\" and are considered as members of a great family. As a Force-using species, Miraluka are often quite shocked if 'shown' life not connected to the Force. \r\n\r\nMany Miraluka worship two gods, Ashla and Bogan, through the philosophy of the Greater Force. They do not believe in good or evil, but were taught to accept both life and death.\r\n\r\nMiraluka Force-sensitives are an order of their own called the Luka Sene. Academic in atmosphere and culture, the Luka Sene focus primarily on developing the sense-related powers of their members. However, unlike the Jedi, Sith and other traditions, the Luka Sene does not dictate a member's personal life.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nMiraluka names are generally two syllables. Miraluka don't use surnames, as they believe they are one family.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Aakih, Pafil, Rikhor, Vociif, Xuwuth\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Auchaod, Favom, Mucem, Wilierth\r\n\r\n### Miraluka Traits\r\nAs a miraluka, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Miraluka reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Miraluka believe in balance and thus tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Miraluka typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Force-Sensitive.*** You know the *mind trick* at-will force power. When you reach 3rd level, you learn and can cast the *sanctuary* force power once per day. When you reach 5th level, you learn and can cast the *force confusion* power once per day. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting ability for these powers.\r\n\r\n***Force Sight.*** Miraluka perceive the environment around them through use of the Force. You are constantly under the effects of the force power *force sight*, though the power does not require concentration for you. \r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Miralukese.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Mirialan\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Green, olive, or yellow|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Black, blonde, brown, or red|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Blue, green, violet, grey, red, yellow, or orange|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Facial tattoos, flexible and agile|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|4'6\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|100 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Mirial|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Mirialan|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nMirialans are a near-human species native to the planet Mirial. They have green to yellow skin and tattoos on their faces. The Mirialans are known for their spirituality and strong connection with the world around them. Mirialans are very flexible and agile, making them fast and formidable foes.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe Mirialan people are deeply religious and practice a primitive understanding of the Force. They believe each individual's actions contribute to their destiny, building upon past successes and failures to drive them towards their fates. Within their belief system was the view that individual actions ripple through the Force, also affecting the destiny of the species as a whole.\r\n\r\nA Mirialan often places a unique, geometrically repeated tattoo on their face and hands to signify that they have completed a certain test or task, or achieved sufficient aptitude for a certain skill. The number of tattoos often acts as a good indicator of how mature and/or skilled a Mirialan was. Because the more markings brings about a form of status, Mirialan society is stratified and allows the heavily marked citizens to access greater opportunities. Despite its importance, most Mirialans do not know the entirety of the tattoo lexicon due to its complexity. The interaction between placement and positioning of the shapes is incredibly subtle and changes their meaning greatly.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nMirialan names are typically concise and rarely more than two syllables. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Boca, Floha, Jemy, Puv, Choqa\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Buf, Ches, Kebe, Ovof, Shaqa\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Acave, Ishakee, Kefvi, Uflozi, Zoria\r\n\r\n### Mirialan Traits\r\nAs a mirialan, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Mirialan reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Mirialans spiritual tendencies cause them to tend towards the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Mirialan typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and weight 150 lbs.

They are divided into two subspecies: the lanky northern mustafarians, and the stocky southern mustafarians. The southern mustafarians were notable for their greater strength, making them more suited to manual labor. Both subspecies shared many traits, particularly their hardened exoskeletons and leathery skin, which acclimated them to the extreme heat of their volcanic environment.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nMustafarians evolved from arthropods living in the slightly cooler hollows within dormant volcanoes on the surface of Mustafar. As a result of such close living, mustafarian culture is isolationist by nature, though they tolerate trade with other systems. Mustafar hosts scarce minerals and rare metals, making mustafarians an invaluable trade partner.\r\n\r\nNative mustafarians rarely take sides when galactic conflicts rage, instead preferring to keep to themselves and control their own planet. They are daunting enemies when provoked, however.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nMustafarian names are often inspired by displays of competency or bravery, such as recovering large quantities of rare minerals, or successfully taming a lava flea. Their surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Aumstrogh, Chivos, Ikt, Ulon\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Altoa, Hailith, Saonji, Yura\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Fal'co, Glost, Mensix, Nek'dem\r\n\r\n### Mustafarian Traits\r\nAs a mustafarian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Mustafarians reach adulthood in their late teens and live about 80 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Mustafarians are usually judicious and value good work above all else, causing them to be lawful balanced, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Mustafarians stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 165 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You ignore the strength property of heavy armor.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** As an originally cave-dwelling species, your eyes are adapted to the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. \r\n\r\n***Lava Dweller.*** Your body is well accustomed to extreme heat, giving you resistance to fire damage. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\r\n\r\n***Refinery Specialist.*** You have proficiency in your choice of constructor's implements, scavenging kit, or surveyor's implements. Additionally, whenever you make an Intelligence (Nature) check to identify a metal or mineral, you are considered to have expertise in the Nature skill.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Mustafarian. Mustafarian consists of choppy clicks and emphatic groans.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Muun\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Light pink or white|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Black or grey|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Three hearts, long limbs, elongated heads|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|5'8\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|145 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Scipio|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Muun|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nMuuns are tall, gaunt humanoids with thin bodies, long limbs, and elongated hairless heads. They typically have pale pink or white skin, most likely derived from their propensity for staying indoors. Muuns have tiny ears on the middle of the sides of their heads, flat noses, and slim mouths which leads to a commonly nasally voice.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nMuuns believe in tradition, with an established culture based on intelligence and merit. A class-based hierarchy, Muuns consider the  the intellectual pursuits \ufffd financiers, lawyers, engineers, diplomats, scientists \ufffd as the highest levels of society. Muun culture, and life, revolves around economics and finance. Intense competition among coworkers encourages economic growth, increased productivity, and superior work ethic. Muuns also have a fundamental respect for justice, though they typically adhere to the letter of the law rather than the spirit.\r\n\r\nSince Muuns tend to shy away from fighting and physical pursuits, Muun society relies on alternative means for their planet's protection, using vast financial resources to purchase massive floating defense platforms to defend their civilization from attack.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nMuun names are typically clear and concise, rarely containing more than two syllables, with familial surnames.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Clu, Hego, Nix, Pors, San\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Dax, Efra, Gil, Rel, Ter\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Card, Damask, Hill, Lesser, Tonith\r\n\r\n### Muun Traits\r\nAs a muun, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Muuns reach adulthood in their late teens and live an average of a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Muuns' lawful culture nature causes them to tend toward lawful balanced, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Muuns typically stand 6 and a half to 7 feet tall and weigh around 200 lbs.

Their eyes also have pupils that split horizontally, and they are distinguished by small lumps on their foreheads and down-turned mouths. Instead of noses, they have olfactory glands underneath their eyes. These genetic differences are attributed to the distinct features of their homeworld, Neimoidia, including its gravity, which is markedly heavier than duro.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nNeimoidians spend their formative years as puny grubs in the communal hives of Neimoidia, until the age of seven standard years. They are knowingly neglected by being given limited amounts of food. This way, the weaker individuals are weeded out, while the most acquisitive grubs hoard more food than they can eat by themselves. Neimoidian education ensures the survival of the greediest. Neimoidians place tremendous value on wealth and material possessions, and would go to great lengths to gain money and power. This has resulted in a stereotype of neimoidians being greedy and cowardly. While not all neimoidians are easily intimidated, many prefer to avoid direct combat.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nNeimoidian names are usually short and easy to pronounce, to make them more memorable to other species that approach them as consumers. Their surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Lok, Gap, Krinit, Mar, Nute\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Bu, Fia, Feza, Vissi\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Dod, How, Kethe, Preelli, Tuuk \r\n\r\n### Neimoidian Traits\r\nAs a neimoidian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Neimoidians reach adulthood in their 20s and live about 150 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Neimoidians' greedy nature causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Neimoidians typically stand around 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 135 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Grovel, Cower, and Beg.*** As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Smooth Talker.*** You have proficiency in Deception and Persuasion.\r\n\r\n***Wealthy.*** During character creation, you start with additional credits equal to your level x your proficiency bonus x 1,000 cr.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Pak Pak.

They hold a limited range of facial expressions because they lack the necessary anatomical infrastructure. Their eyes are covered by a protective membrane, being a thin transparent pellicle that protects their eyes underwater and during windstorms. As a result, they are noted for their \"staring\" eyes and a seemingly blank expression which leads to many underestimating nikto intelligence.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nAlthough lacking in personal charisma, nikto posses a single-minded tenacity that makes them excellent followers. Their lives made nikto cunning combatants. Most nikto are content with a life of servitude as in their eyes a life in slavery was preferable to the hardship and toil on their homeworld. Not all nikto work for the hutts though most free members of their kind were formerly enslaved. Whilst nikto are known to escape from their master, most tend to fall into service of another hutt who \"inherited\" them according to custom should their previous employer die. However, some escaped nikto did instead use some opportunities to genuinely become free beings. Any such emancipated nikto have to be constantly on guard as they risked capture by hutt-employed slavers who return their prey to their \"rightful owners\". In addition, they lacked charisma and preferred to follow orders instead of giving them. As a result, the Nikto were most identified with their Hutt masters.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nNikto names are very complex, hard to pronounce, and harsh sounding. Name length also differs a lot, longer names having apostrophes or dashes. Their names are unisex, with surnames being familiar and optional. \r\n\r\n**First Names.** Jydabaum, N'rok'ratu, Sussa, Vydgish\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Gozorc, Irtitt, Qegmarg, Umpluurg\r\n\r\n### Nikto Traits\r\nAs a nikto, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Nikto reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Nikto's self-sufficient and clever nature causes them to tend toward balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Nikto typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n***Protective Membrane.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being blinded.\r\n\r\n***Radiation Resistant.*** The dying star nearby their homeworld makes nikto naturally used to radiation. You have resistance to necrotic damage.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, Nikto, and Huttese. Nikto is spoken with sharp syllables with a deep and rumbling cadence.\r\n\r\n***Adaptation.*** The frequent radiation bursts from the nearby dying star caused the nikto to mutate and adapt into different subspecies over time, specialized for different environments.

A natural gift for stealth and hand-to-hand combat, Noghri are efficient killing machines with their rending claws and strong olfactory sense that can often determine familial lineage. Their smaller size belies their ruthlessness and potent hunting skills.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nNoghri culture relies heavily on honor, with society being clan-based, revolving around the Dukha, a community center in each village. The greatest strength of the Noghri stems from their loyalty and secrecy; when a Noghri takes a job, they always fulfill it, even if it would result in their death. As such, they make exceptional, albeit expensive bodyguards.\r\n\r\nNoghri are loathe to fight with weapons larger than small daggers, believing combat to be a personal celebration to be sullied by use of heavier weapons. As such, it is rare (though not impossible) to see a Noghri wielding a weapon larger than their forearm.\r\n\r\nEach Noghri clan village centers around the Dukha, with each clan being led by a Dynast. The Dukha is inhabited by the clan's Maitrakh, who functions as the storyteller, spiritual leader, and lore keep of the clan.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nNoghri names vary from short to long, with female names being typically softer. Surnames are clan-based.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Cakhmaim, Ezrakh, Khabarakh, Rukh\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Cilnaas, Edvir, Kahr'corvh, Meewalh\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Bakh'tor, Eikh'mir, Hakh'khar, Khim'bar\r\n\r\n### Noghri Traits\r\nAs a noghri, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Noghri reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Noghri's honorable society causes them to tend toward a lawful alignment, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Noghri typically stand about 5 feet tall and weigh around 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Hunter.*** You are proficient in Survival and Stealth.\r\n\r\n***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.\r\n\r\n***Powerful Leap.*** If you jump at least 10 feet in a straight line before hitting with a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to trip the target prone as part of the same attack. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Strong-Legged.*** When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier.\r\n\r\n***Unarmed Combatant.*** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage and have the finesse property.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Honorghran. Honorghran is characterized by its scratchy, gutteral sounds.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Nothoiin\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  | Golden |\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  | Blond, brown, light brown |\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  | Brown |\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  | Near-human, flaky golden skin, skilled pilots |\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'8\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |110 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  | Nothoiin |\r\n> |***Language***|  | Notho |\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nNear-humans possessing golden, flaky skin, nothoiins feature fair to brown hair with brown eyes and typically have physical heights and builds common to humans.  Nothoiins' appearance has earned their species the nickname of \"Goldskins.\"\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nAlthough nothoiins hail from their eponymous homeworld and star system in the Anoat Sector, they are ubiquitous throughout the Greater Javin Region and Corporate Sectors.  Their history of interstellar exploration and colonization was facilitated by their species' natural spacefaring abilities in both piloting and navigation and necessitated by their home planet's periodically harsh, dry climate.  Droughts on Nothoiin can last for decades, and the wildfires they foster have served as one of the primary factors behind the limited development of the planet's economy beyond the ur-diamond mining industry, which produces the system's chief export.  \r\n\r\nLarge-scale emigration from Nothoiin has led members of its native species to seek careers as pilots, navigators, and operatives in numerous criminal enterprises.  Various nothoiin colonies have given rise to a number of different governmental systems running the gamut from representative democracies to autocracies.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nNothoiin typically receive a gendered given name and a familial surname.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Amrosio, Jado, Kosimas, Troov\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Elayah, Giranti, Lorinah, Sil\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Caban, Mordu, Plintus, Starstrider\r\n\r\n### Nothoiin Traits\r\nAs a nothoiin, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.***  Nothoiin reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Nothoiins tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Nothoiins typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Born Pilots.*** Nothoiins demonstrate seemingly innate piloting abilities from a very young age.  You have proficiency in the Piloting skill.\r\n\r\n***Expert Navigators.*** You are considered to have expertise in Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate.\r\n\r\n***Galactic Traveler.*** You have proficiency in the Lore skill.\r\n\r\n***Heightened Reflexes.*** Whenever you make a Dexterity ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to add 1d4 to the result. You can use this before or after the roll, but before the GM determines the roll's outcome. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n***Major Miners.*** Nothoiins have intimate knowledge of ur-diamond mining and refinement practices.  You gain proficiency in your choice of jeweler's implements, scavenging kit, or archaeologist kit.\r\n\r\n***Starship Specialists.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check related to starships, you are considered to have expertise in the Technology skill.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one language of your choice. You can also communicate via Notho, a native hand language developed by hunters living in the Nothoiin plains.  Usage of Notho is exceedingly rare outside Nothoiin culture.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Ortolan\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Light colors|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Light colors|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Yellow|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Stocky builds, trunklike noses, floppy ears, small mouths, brightly dyed fur|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|2'10\"|+2d4\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|50 lb.|x1 lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Orto|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Ortolan|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nOrtolans are squat, heavily-built humanoid bipeds with long, trunklike noses and beady black eyes. They possess floppy ears, which are extremely sensitive to sound waves. They have two hands, each ending in four chubby fingers and a thumb, which is not opposable. A thick, baggy hide covered in fuzz resembling velvet hangs off of the Ortolan body. Ortolans have a keen sense of smell to help them forage for food. In fact, they are handicapped in their business affairs by their attachment to food, sometimes accepting otherwise unfavorable contracts when promised enough to eat. Their twin obsessions are food and music; offworld, many Ortolans find success as chefs or musicians. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nOrtolan society is reasonably industrialised, though not as technologically advanced as other species. Despite this, their economy is mostly based on barter, with credits primarily used to trade with offworlders. Education is the responsibility of their parents, though gifted youngsters are often traded to other families to get specialized education. \r\n\r\nWhile most Ortolans appear to have blue skin, Ortolans are actually covered in short velvety fur which they often dyed in bright colors, most often blue and pink.  This tradition began when a Devaronian trader tried to sell Ortolans a shipment of food dyes\ufffdthey considered dyeing their food a waste of time, but found dyed fur to be quite stylish.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nOrtolan names are generally short with big sounds. Female names are typically softer. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male names.** Donmb, Hegh, Nax, Parm, Teeb\r\n\r\n**Female names.** Bedla, Folfe, Nelni, Phoff, Sallo\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Bigek, Lubum, Nad, Rojool, Somo \r\n\r\n### Ortolan Traits\r\nAs an ortolan, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Ortolans are considered adults at the age of seven and typically live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Ortolans' love of food and music causes them to tend toward chaotic light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Ortolans stand around 3 to 4 feet tall and weigh about 55 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Foragers.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Survival) check to forage for food you are considered to have expertise in the Survival skill.\r\n\r\n***Grovel, Cower, and Beg.*** As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** Your thick hide is naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\r\n\r\n***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing or smell.\r\n\r\n***Musical.*** You have proficiency in Performance and one musical instrument of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields. Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Ortolan. Ortolan is characterized by its grunts and hoots.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Pa'lowick\r\n> ___\r\n> ##### Visual Characteristics\r\n> | | |\r\n> |:---|:------------|:------------:|\r\n> |***Skin Color***| Generally tan and greenish hues|\r\n> |***Hair Color***| None |\r\n> | ***Eye Color***| Green, blue, gray, red-orange|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|Long snout, bulbous body on thin legs|\r\n> ___\r\n> ##### Physical Charicteristics\r\n> | |   | |\r\n> |:---|:------------:|:------------:|\r\n> |  ***Height*** |4'6\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |  ***Weight*** | 65 lbs. |x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> ##### Sociocultural Charicteristics\r\n> | | |\r\n> |:---|:------------|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|Lowick|\r\n> |***Language***|Lowickese|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe pa'lowick are a species of humanoid amphibians who live in the coastal salt marshes of Lowick. They have compact but rotund midsections that top a pair of long, spindly legs ending in anisodactylic feet\ufffdthree toes pointing forward, one back. This configuration, combined with their powerful lungs, enabled them to swim.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent feature of pa'lowick physiology is their prehensile snout, which ends in a pair of pouty, human-like lips. Pa'lowick are also born with sharp tusks, which some lose by middle age.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nPa'lowick live in large, independent communities with a feudal system of government. Many pa'lowick become fishers or hunters, as their biology allows. \r\n\r\nSongs and stories are the most treasured aspect of pa'lowick culture. Pa'lowick music runs the gamut of genres and subjects, although religious music is particularly common. Cultural heritage, such as history, genealogy, and parables, is largely passed down orally. Every Pa'lowick community has a dedicated storyteller; the esteem afforded this individual makes the position a coveted one. Large lungs make the Pa'lowick hearty singers and affords at least some members of the species the ability to scream loudly and disarm opponents in combat.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nPa'lowick names tend to grow longer as the family tree grows older, with each generation adding a few syllables they are fond of.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Loran, Jelanto, Neeamesh, Samoos\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Larisselle, Rensilla, Sy, Tripika\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Chatrunis, Dym, Geeci, Snootles\r\n\r\n### Pa'lowick Traits\r\nAs a pa'lowick, you have the following special traits:\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Pa'lowick reach adulthood in their late teens and live about 75 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Pa'lowick enjoy a raucous good time, causing them to tend toward chaotic light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Pa'lowick stand about 5 feet tall, and weigh approximately 100 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Hold Breath.*** Pa'lowick have a great lung capacity and can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.\r\n\r\n***Proud Performer.*** Pa'lowick are best known for the energy they can bring to a singing performance. Whenever you make a Charisma (Performance) check involving singing, you are considered to have expertise in the Performance skill.\r\n\r\n***Snout.*** You have supreme control over your snout and can use it to manipulate objects as well as your hands. Additionally, your snout is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Sonic Scream.*** As an action, you can violently expel air in a 15-foot cone. When you do so, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). A creature takes 2d6 sonic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 4d6 at 5th level, 6d6 at 11th level, and 8d6 at 17th level. This ability has no effect on constructs. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Lowickese. Lowickese requires the user to purse their lips and blow air, and is considered amusing by other species.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Pantoran\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Blue|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Black, white, or pastel colors|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Yellow or rarely black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Blue skin, yellow eyes, cold resilience|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'9\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |90 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Pantora|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Pantoran|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nPantorans are a sentient species native to Pantora, a moon orbiting the planet Orto Plutonia. At first glance, they only differ from the otherwise similar humans in their blue skin and yellow eyes. The pantorans share many traits with other blue-skinned races, especially the wroonians, and, to a lesser extent, the chiss. The pantorans also seem to have a greater resilience to low temperatures than humans, since they only needed light wardrobe even under extreme cold weather conditions. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nPantoran society developed on Pantora, a world located in a region flush with slavers and spice merchants. Constant run-ins with these types led the pantorans to become fiercely independent and proud. While the pantoran society is democratic, the feudal traditions of marking their foreheads, and cheeks with yellow markings to symbolize lineage persists into the common era. These traditions spurred a cultural interest in genealogy and history, and many pantorans cherish relics from the past such as jewelry which connect them to their noble ancestors or helmets that belonged to great heroes of a bygone age. The old nation states of Pantora are unified under a democratic planetary government, the politics of which are considered an art form. Governed by the Pantoran Assembly, the elected body is led by a Speaker, who balance the power of the chief executive officer, known as the Chairman. \r\n### Names\r\nPantoran use sophisticated names with numerous vowels, though often sound similar human names. \r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Charl, Ikurrece, Maatsu, Pulengo\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Freyu, Jicelli, Nandia, Suya\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Ipujarero, Molidias, Tuteru, Vagana\r\n\r\n### Pantoran Traits\r\nAs a pantoran, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Intelligence or Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Pantorans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Pantorans' interest in politics causes them to tend towards lawful alignments, though there are exceptions. \r\n\r\n***Size.*** Pantorans typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Cold Adaptation.*** You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme cold.\r\n\r\n***Cultured.*** You have proficiency in the Lore skill.\r\n\r\n***Impose Order.*** As a bonus action, you can command each ally within 15 feet of you to move up to half that ally's speed as a reaction. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Once you use this trait, you can\ufffdt use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Negotiators.*** You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks meant to negotiate terms or agreements between parties.\r\n\r\n***Organized.*** Your society values organization, and as such you are good at making good use of the space provided. When you are in charge of packing a space, such as a vehicle or cargo hold, that space's carrying capacity is increased by one-fourth its base capacity.\r\n\r\n***Political Guile.*** You are proficient in Persuasion or Deception (your choice). \r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Pantoran. Pantoran comprises many dialects that prevent clear communication, a vestige of the feudal culture of the planet's past. Because of the difficulties of operating a planetary government with so many different languages, the Assembly established Galactic Basic as the official language of their people as a means of unifying the planet. \r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Patrolian\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Blue-purple to green|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Light to dark red|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Fin-like limbs, pastel-color scales|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |2'8\"|+2d4\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |35 lb.|x1 lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Patrolia|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Patrolian|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nPatrolians are fish-like in appearance, covered in pale, pastel-colored scales and possessing numerous fins on their long limbs and face, as well as a notable dorsal fin which often require modified clothing to accommodate. \r\n\r\nThanks to their gills, patrolians are perfectly comfortable breathing underwater as well as on land, and their physiology is also notoriously resistant to electric shocks\ufffdboth likely throwbacks to evolution on their native homeworld of Patrolia.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nPatrolians are a notably innovative and resourceful species, and many of their number have found their way into roles in the construction, maintenance and sale of technology. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, patrolians tend to pursue these businesses in a shady manner, and most tend to operate such ventures in the criminal underworld, working as bounty hunters, thieves, fences, slicers and other such technically-demanding criminal roles. \r\n\r\nThis inclination towards crime stems from their homeworld, which is perpetually stalled in a state of economic decay due to wartime. With the advent of multiple wars fought in the system, different armies continue to see the aquatic world as a strategic bulwark in the region. Because of this, patrolians have to find work not only off-world, but typically in fields not falling under governmental purview; unfortunately, criminal activities are the most common path. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nPatrolian names are usually multisyllabic and sing-songy with lots of open vowels and few fricatives. Patrolians are not known to use family names or other surnames.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Dalladu, Feddi, Nogagai, Teconica\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Kakeda, Machibido, Rinimma, Talla\r\n\r\n### Patrolian Traits\r\nAs a patrolian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity or Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Patrolians reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Patrolians' greedy, scheming nature causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Patrolians typically stand just over 3 feet tall and generally weigh about 40 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.\r\n\r\n***Conniving.*** You have proficiency in Deception or Stealth (your choice). \r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underwater, you have superior vision in low light conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Electrical Resistance.*** Patrolians are notably capable of shrugging off electricity. You have resistance to lightning damage.\r\n\r\n***Specialist.*** You have proficiency in one specialist's kit of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Technician.*** You are proficient in the Technology skill.\r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields. Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Patrolian. Patrolian is a high-energy language, consisting mostly of gurgles and skittish vocalizations. Patrolian, even when spoken on land, sounds like it's being spoken underwater. \r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Pau'an\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Gray or white|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Black or silver|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Red eye sockets, pinstriped skin, long lifespan, jagged teeth|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'0\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |120 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Utapau|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Utapese|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nPau'ans have large, sunken black eyes in red eye sockets and jagged, fang-like teeth used for tearing into raw meat, as they are carnivores. The species has pale, wrinkled skin, due to the fact that they lived in the sinkholes of Utapau, giving them limited access to light. These traits cause some to view them as frightening. However, Pau'ans as a society are generally friendly, and are happy to welcome guests to their often overlooked world. Pau'ans have long lifespans, living up to 700 years, much longer than the Utai. This earned them the nickname of \"Ancients\".\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nPau'ans fulfill most of the governmental and administrative duties on Utapau, as the utai do not desire such work, serving as laborers instead. Most pau'ans served as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai laborers. This gives them experience that will be used later in their lives. Pau'ans are kind leaders, and sympathetic to their subordinates. Each city on Utapau is controlled by a Master of Port Administration, a hereditary title reserved for pau'ans. These administrators are assisted by advisory councils for making important decisions about their city, and each administrator serves on the Utapauan Committee and oversees planetary governance. However, the committee rarely makes crucial decisions, as the cities are able to function on their own most of the time.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nPau'an names are fairly simple, and generally melodic. Surnames are familial. \r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Kernul, Sivrol, Tar, Vizun, Yal, Zeolbud\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Cas, Jevoh, Nesim, Sizil, Ten, Yofan\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Gesat, Kluneln, Nom, Vley, Voy, Zet\r\n\r\n### Pau'an Traits\r\nAs a pau'an, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. \r\n\r\n***Age.*** Pau'ans reach adulthood in their 30's and have been known to live up to 700 years old. \r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Pau'ans' commanding presence, yet friendly and kind nature, cause them to tend to be lawful light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Pau'ans typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and generally weigh about 150 lbs.

They have two long, lanky legs, and two arms that end in three-fingered hands. Their heads are large and elongated, with a tapered skull and an undersized face, a feature which some other species find unsettling. Pykes had two narrow, almond-shaped eyes which could be magenta or blue in color.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nPykes hail from Oba Diah, a terrestrial planet marked by obsidian cliffs. Visitors to Oba Diah view both the population and terrain as unwelcoming. The pyke homeworld serves as the headquarters of the Pyke Syndicate, a criminal dealership within the Spice Cartel that operates in the criminal underworld distributing spice, an illicit substance harvested by slaves in the spice mines of the planet Kessel. To deliver spice to their customers, such as crime families on Coruscant, the Pyke Syndicate relies on smugglers and freighter captains to complete the dangerous Kessel Run. The Pyke Syndicate almost completely controls the production of raw spice in the galaxy, while maintaining tentative alliances with other criminal organizations throughout the galaxy, such as the Black Sun and the Crimson Dawn. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nPyke names are often influenced by naming conventions of other species, with their rarely-used surnames being familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Dor, Eife, Qalo, Thok, Zret\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Gali, Taela, Shethni, Vent, Zeeren\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Kemtol, Nek, Pyke, Safet, Welkor \r\n\r\n### Pyke Traits\r\nAs a pyke, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Pykes reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Due to their underhanded nature, Pykes tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Pykes typically stand 6 to 6 and a half feet tall and generally weigh about 155 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.\r\n\r\n***Mercantile.*** You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Persuasion, or Intimidation. \r\n\r\n***Notorious Slavers.*** Whenever you make an ability check related to the buying, selling, or controlling of slaves, you are considered proficient in the check.

They have a pair of deep, turquoise eyes and finned hands with suction-tipped fingers. As an amphibious species, they are strong swimmers. They are also bipedal beings that can walk and sit upright. In the two long protrusions that extended from either side of their faces, Quarren have gill-like structures that are actually hearing organs. The Quarren are also capable of spitting out clouds of ink as a defensive measure.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nQuarren are a very self-centered and proud species, almost to the point of being xenophobic, would coincides with their isolationist behavior. Quarren find Humans to be very crude beings and think Galactic Basic to be very cumbersome and unsuitable for speech. The Quarren instead speak their native language more frequently.\r\n\r\nThe Quarren are conservative and practical in their thinking, yet they reminisce more than they look to the future. The Quarren are isolationist, preferring to stay in the depths of the oceans of their homeworld. However, some Quarren make their living in the galaxy as business managers and accountants. The Quarren diligently mine metal ore from the deepest parts of the ocean, where they live deep beneath the waves. Their cities stretch far below the surface.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nQuarren names are typically harsh. Male and female names do not significantly deviate. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Names.** Bagker, Jujon, Kibkyl, Qiockish, Yuntoz\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Chobnek, Geeckol, Nukranx, Tsastanx\r\n\r\n### Quarren Traits\r\nAs a quarren, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Quarren reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Quarren desire for equal rights causes them to tend toward balanced, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Quarren typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh about 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.\r\n\r\n***Climb.*** You have a climbing speed of 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Ink Cloud.*** As an action, you can expel ink in a 10-foot cone. When you do so, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the end of its next turn. This ability has no effect on constructs. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n***Keen Hearing.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.\r\n\r\n***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Quarrenese.

Equipped with long necks for peering over vegetation mats, bulbous heads with a permanently bemused smile, and two sets of spindly arms, they also have two brains, one located in the chest cavity. Their two brains can cause mental problems when each brain developed a different personality, but also gives them a type of \"telepathy\" which they attribute to an ability to better observe and understand body language. Possessing no noses, the olfactory glands of this species are found in the hands.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nQuermians are a gentle, unassuming people. They embrace reason, shun violence, and enjoy interacting with members of other species and cultures. A peaceful society developed on Quermia without arkanian interference, as the quermians evolved on their own in the absence of any predators or outside intervention. As a race they are dedicated to complex philosophical ideas, and many of the galaxy's most prominent diplomats and thinkers are found among their ranks. While they have four arms and are capable of using both sets with ease, they prefer to keep the lower set hidden beneath their robes when dealing with offworlders.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nQuermian names are usually one to three syllables long, featuring hard or soft consonants.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Murk, Koa, Jedoo, Vinian \r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Gouren, Kindee, Meroo, Kiaa  \r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Kreen, Lundi, Raelo, Bactra\r\n\r\n### Quermian Traits\r\nAs a quermian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Quermians reach adulthood in their early teens and live a little under a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Querians philosophic culture causes them to tend toward light alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Quermians typically stand 7 to 8 feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Diplomatic.*** You have proficiency with Insight or Persuasion (your choice).\r\n\r\n***Four-Armed.*** Quermians have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).\r\n\r\n***Natural Empathy.*** Quermians' talent at reading the body language of others allow them to sense the emotions in those around them. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine emotions against humanoids and beasts within 10 feet of you.\r\n\r\n***Two Brains.*** When you make a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the roll. Once you've done so, you must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again.\r\n\r\n***Watchful.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Quermian. You can also communicate with other quermians more effectively through a thorough understanding of body language that xenobiologists widely attribute to latent telepathy.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Rakata\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Blue, green, grey, or red|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Blue, brown, gold, or yellow|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Horizontal eye stalks, vertical blade shaped head, tridactyl hands|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'8\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |125 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Lehon|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Rakata|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nIn appearance, rakata are smooth skinned amphibian-like humanoids that had tall craniums along with eyes that protruded from each side of their heads on short stalks. These bipedal beings have three digit hands that are tipped with claws for digging through packed dirt. As a species, they are uniformly lean and tall; while most rakata have a similar height and weight, females tend to be more slender than males, though just as tall. Rakata are primarily carnivorous, likely stemming from the fact that they are cannibalistic, often making a meal of other species.\r\n\r\nLong term abuse of the Force in their society, exacerbated by a plague, culled the rakata's ability to sense the Force.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nRakatan technology and structures hold the unique property of blending with the Force, creating powerful and long-lasting monuments that are almost impossibly to replicate. Rakatan society is devoted to conquering and enslaving those they deem weak. At the height of its power, the Rakatan Infinite Empire had conquered and enslaved dozens of worlds. They would strip entire planets of their resources and then terraform them to fit their own needs.\r\n\r\nAfter a plague ravaged their civilization and caused the fall of the Infinite Empire, rakata broke off into smaller tribes rather than a unified organization. Despite their newfound tribal nature, rakata retained their ability to quickly adapt to and appropriate technology.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nRakatan names do not distinguish by gender, and they do not use surnames.\r\n\r\n**Names.** Ceh'let, Orsaa, Skal'nas, Soa, Tul'kar\r\n\r\n### Rakata Traits\r\nAs a rakata, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Rakata reach adulthoood by 20 and rarely live longer than 90 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Rakata's propensity towards war and aggression cause them to tend toward lawful dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Rakata typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 180 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Adaptive Resilience.*** Prolongued use of technology allows rakata to readily adapt to its effects. You have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws against tech powers.\r\n\r\n***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.\r\n\r\n***Cannibalize.*** If you spend at least 1 minute devouring the corpse of a beast or humanoid, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n***Claws.*** Your claws are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Force-Insensitive.*** While rakata can be manipulated by many force powers, they can not sense the Force. You can not use force powers or take levels in forcecasting classes.\r\n\r\n***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Technician.*** You are proficient in the Technology skill.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Rakata. Rakata is characterized by its deep tones and simplistic nature, using mainly consonants and long vowels. It's script seems to be a very ancient form of Galactic Basic.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Rattataki\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Chalk-white|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Brown, grey or white|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Grey or white|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Near-human features, white skin, usually with a bald head, often tattooed|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|4'4\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|90 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Rattatak|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Rattataki|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe Rattataki are a near-human species characterized by their nimble movements, chalk-white skin and oft-bald heads. Virtually isolated from the rest of the galaxy, the Rattataki developed a violent society on their home planet of Rattatak, which involves extensive gladiatorial combat. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nWhile most other inhabitants of Rattatak came from the Unknown Regions, there are a significant number of off-worlder mercenaries who come to Rattatak from time to time, likely to view or participate in gladiatorial combat, only to be stranded there permanently. The remarkably harsh conditions on the planet nearly drove its population to extinction. For eons, the Rattataki constantly battled amongst themselves and their fellow inhabitants (represented primarily by Humans, Zabraks, Siniteens, Vollick, and Weequay) over the planet's limited resources. Despite being nearly completely isolated from the outside galaxy, the Rattataki displayed remarkable initiative and continually created new ways to kill each other.\r\n\r\nRattataki culture is bloody and unforgiving. Punishment for even the smallest crimes is unnecessarily harsh, which does little to quell that behavior. In fact, Rattataki who are known to commit crimes without being caught are celebrated.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nRattataki names are harsh sounding and short. Surnames are familial, though many Rattataki abandon them in favor of self-aggrandizing titles.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Aidus, Charnagus, Karok, Veran\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Amaran, Kassien, Silas, Sraja, Vol\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Anjek, Danvik, Degger, Kolla, Venkorr\r\n\r\n### Rattataki Traits\r\nAs a rattataki, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity or Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Rattataki reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Rattataki are self-serving and violent which causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Rattataki typically stand about 5 and a half feet tall and weigh 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.\r\n\r\n***Acrobatic.*** You have proficiency in Acrobatics.\r\n\r\n***Intimidating.*** You have proficiency in Intimidation.\r\n\r\n***Surprise Attack.*** If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it. You can use this trait only once per combat.\r\n\r\n***Unarmed Combatant.*** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage and have the finesse property.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Rattataki. Rattataki is known for have an inordinate amount of curses.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Rishii\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Yellow|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Brown or white|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Brown or yellow|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Sound mimicry, enhanced hearing and sight|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|4'2\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|60 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Rishi|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Rishii|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nRishii are a sentient, avian species of carnivores which possess two legs ending in four-toed feet, two arms, a tail, and a head. The species' two arms consist of feathered wings ending in nimble humanoid hands, capable of manipulating tools. The wings grant the Rishii the ability to fly at great speeds, which is their method of travel equivalent to running in land-based species. A Rishii's head contained a beak between two yellow eyes framed by a large brow. Rishii were capable of mimicking anything said to them perfectly, and also possessed extremely strong senses, particularly hearing and sight. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nNative to the planet Rishi, the Rishii live in loose primitive tribes, known as nests, clustered high upon the planet's mountains, away from the hot and humid lowland swamps. Each nest consists of a small number of family units led by a chieftain, with neighbouring nests respecting each others territories and living in harmony. This peaceful and accepting attitude goes beyond just other Rishii and was extended to all neighbours of a nest, including the many other species who colonise the lowlands of Rishi. Due to the unfavorable conditions found in the lowlands, the native avians do not understand the off-worlders' choice to live there, but were not opposed to their presence.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nAs with much of their speech, Rishii names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. Rishii names do not vary based on gender. Rishii are responsive to nicknames given by outsiders. \r\n\r\n### Rishii Traits\r\nAs a rishii, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Rishii reach adulthood at 10 and generally live no longer than 60 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Rishii tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Rishii range from 4 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh less than 130 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Flight.*** You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. While wearing medium or heavy armor, your flying speed is reduced by half.\r\n\r\n***Keen Hearing and Sight.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.\r\n\r\n***Mimicry.*** You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Rishii. Rishii's clicks, trills, and whistles are difficult for outsiders to learn without the aid of a protocol droid, and so Rishii often feel comfortable speaking to eachother in the language in front of others.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Ryn\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Blue, black, green, purple|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Light brown to white|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Amber, blue, brown, or green|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Long tails, beak-like noses|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'4\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |75 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Unknown|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Ryn|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nTheir homeworld long lost from memory and time, the ryn are a humanoid race of musicians, vagabonds and travelers. The ryn's bodies are covered in soft, short fur, with a head of white hair which is matched by a tuft of hair at the end of their long prehensile tails, excellent for grasping things. Very uniquely ryn in nature, are their beak-like noses that contain fluted holes. These holes allow the ryn to play their 'beaks' like flutes. This talent has been used to communicate between ryn and has uniquely been observed in communication with droids.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nWanderlust consumes the ryn. The ryn are a nomadic species, their original homeworld forgotten, even to them. They cannot abide confinement and constraint, and they itch to move on shortly after they arrive in a new place. Due to their homelessness, musical talent, natural secrecy, and avoidance of written records, ryn developed a nomadic culture and a reputation for confidence games, leaving many species prejudiced against them. In some sectors it is legal to enslave or hunt ryn. Their language is outlawed in many locations, and a large number of ryn women are used as slave breeding stock. They claim that sabaac, the popular card game that took the place of Pazaak in terms of card game prominence, is derived from their use of it as a fortune telling tool in their auguries.

Their heads resemble sting rays and they have a blue, pink, or green skin naturally patterned as an underwater camouflage. Their mouths are bracketed by cephalic lobes. Female Selkath differed from males due to the presence of tendrils on the back of their heads.\r\n\r\nAll members of the Selkath race have rectractable, venom-tipped claws. The use of these claws in any form of combat or attack was considered dishonorable and a sign of madness; to do this was to give in to animal instincts unbecoming of a sentient species. Because of the Selkath's water-dwelling nature, their chest armors were fitted with misting vents in order to keep their skin moist.\r\n\r\n### Society & Culture\r\nSelkath are native to the planet Manaan, the only naturally occurring source of the medical liquid referred to as kolto. The Selkath have leveraged this monopoly on maintain their neutrality, peddling their invaluable healing supplies to all comers.\r\n\r\nManaan is an ocean planet is home to only one above-surface settlement, the floating Ahto City, built directly above Hrakert Rift, the most abundant source of kolto on Manaan.  As bacta began to replace the inferior kolto on the galactic stage, Manaan fell from their previously respected position, shirking away their previous prestige and causing many Selkath to disappear from the galactic eye into isolationism and tribalism. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nSelkath names tend to have a flowing quality to it, like a stream of water.

As such individuals tend towards the neutral balanced alignment, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n**Size.** Selkath typically stand between 4 and a half to 5 and a half feet tall and average 130 pounds.

On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of its next turn, and you can't use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n**Gift of the Progenitor.** You know the *temporary boost* at-will tech power.

Their bodies are covered by a sleek fur and they normally do not wear clothing. However, when working or visiting offworld, they wear appropriate outfits. Their long bodies are equally comfortable walking on either two or four legs. Their long tails serve as a counterbalance for their bodies when standing upright. These tails are equally capable of being used as potent bludgeoning weapons in combat. At the end of their paw-like hands are retractable claws which not only gives them the capacity to dig but also makes them excellent climbers. They have long pointed faces with bristly whiskers as well as long teeth. Most selonians born are infertile females. One in every hundred are male, and one in every five hundred are fertile females.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nDespite the massive starship traffic to Corellia, many visitors and even native Corellians know very little of the selonians and their distinctive unique alien culture. In mindset, they are a thoroughly grounded and serious race who are primarily concerned with the safety of their people. This means that the protection of their family dens and their species as a whole was a chief concern. The basis for this line of thinking is because they viewed that the needs of the society outweighed the needs of the individual. To those unaware of the deeper intricacies of the race, the selonians appear as an outgoing, friendly and charitable species. However, their interests rarely go beyond securing the good of their respective den.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nSelonian use punctual names with no surnames.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Duldayd, Gov, Krez, Qaran\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Chu, Driacnear, Fiircasa, Shilis\r\n\r\n### Selonian Traits\r\nAs a selonian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Selonians reach adulthood in their mid teens and live for about 75 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Selonians are serious and den-focused, causing them to tend towards lawful balanced, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Selonians typically stand 6 to 7 feet tall and generally weigh about 180 lbs.

Shistavanen also possess large glowing eyes, and can also run at high speeds for long periods without getting tired, alternately using two or four limbs. As predators, they possess keen hearing and smell and excellent night vision.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nAs a species, the Shistavanen are isolationists. The species colonized all the unpopulated worlds in the Uvena system to prevent them from being settled by non-Shistavanen, and their restrictive trade laws (which are unapologetic in how they favor their own kind over off-world traders).  Most of their society uses technology similar to the rest of the galaxy, though some parts of Uvena Prime use slightly less sophisticated technology.\r\n\r\nA minority of Shistavanen are more outgoing, and travel the galaxy's hyperlanes. Even these Shistavanen usually remain by themselves or with other Shistavanen. Due to their natural predatory instincts, Shistavanen commonly find employment as scouts, mercenaries and bounty hunters. Many other species react badly to Shistavanen, since their isolationist culture makes them an unfamiliar sight, and their predatory appearance put other species on edge.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nShistavanen first names typically sound graceful, while their surnames are more gutteral. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Bustuc, Hulvav, Kembol, Nemdav, Sirul\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Gaeft, Laer, Recloz, Shaalir, Thovnim\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Ghirat, Lakrevl, Meq, Nukroft, Rosk\r\n\r\n### Shistavanen Traits\r\nAs a shistavanen, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Shistavanen reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Shistavanen are private and tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Shistavanen typically stand around 6 feet tall and weigh between 140 and 190 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

Shistavanen have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid Exhaustion due to prolongued travel, as described in Chapter 8.\r\n\r\n***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing or smell.\r\n\r\n***Regenerative.*** When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Hit Die to regain hit points as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.\r\n\r\n***Tooth and Nail.*** Your fangs and claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Shistavanen.

Their pink skin is covered in fur that offers some protection from cold weather, but, more importantly, it serves as an olfactory organ, able to pick up scents at a distance and ascertain intrinsic details\ufffdsuch as penetrating through a disguise or identifying a forgery\ufffdwhen rubbed against. The species has both male and female sexes, although non-Squibs often have difficulty determining the sex of a Squib based on appearance alone. Their mouths are full of forbidding, sharp, white teeth, and their flexible cheeks were capable of storing items.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nSquibs are friendly and cheerful to such an extent that, over time, they are considered quite annoying. Squibs are inherently curious, handling items with little regard to care. They are unabashed pack rats, and they wear clothing for the excess storage rather than necessity. The Squibs' overconfidence is a defining trait. The typical Squib response to a threat is not to fight or flee, but to bluff and bluster, especially when not face-to-face. In person, their sharp teeth are their favored means of intimidation. Squibs believe that bargaining is the highest form of communication, and they believe haggling is more important than the goods themselves. A deal is a binding oath to Squibs, and they are incredibly loyal to their business partners.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nSquibs combine their first and last names, which are familial, into one long, hyphenated name. They often go by nicknames derived from their full names. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.\r\n\r\n**Full Names.** Galaneever-marmalios, Meelawin-demort, Sleerinwilpher-remalior\r\n\r\n**Nicknames.** Galan, Meela, Wilpher\r\n\r\n### Squib Traits\r\nAs a squib, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Squibs reach adulthood at nine years of age and live an average of sixty-five years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Squibs' cheerful nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Squibs typically stand 3 to 3 and a half feet tall and weigh around 50 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Bite.*** Your sharp teeth are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Business Savvy.*** A common trait of all Squibs is their desire and love of haggling. Squibs believe a deal is done when both sides believe they got the better of the other. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.\r\n\r\n***Flexible Cheeks.***  Squibs have flexible cheeks in which they can store small goods. You can store up to two items that weigh a combined total of no more than 2 lb. in your cheeks, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal them.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** Your thick hide is naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\r\n\r\n***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.\r\n\r\n***Sensitive Fur.*** Squibs' fur is exceptionally sensitive to physical details. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on touch.\r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields. Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Squibbian. The Squibbian language originated as a secret form of communication for Squibs to convey information without being understood.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Ssi-Ruu \r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Brown, red, or tan scales|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Solid black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Reptilian, tails, scent-tongues|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'7\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |200 lb.|x(2d6) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Lwhekk|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Ssi-ruuvi|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nSsi-ruuk are a predatory, warm-blooded saurian species gifted with ferocious strength, remarkable speed, and sharp fangs and claws, traits that serve them well in the volcanic jungles of their homeworld of Lwhekk. Their muscular forms combined with their powerful tails make them very agile hunters, and their colorfully-scaled hides have been proven to be resistant even to blaster bolts. From their nostrils, two scent-tongues protrude that grant them enhanced olfactory senses, compensating for the poor vision afforded them by their dark, three-lidded eyes. No Ssi-ruu has ever been known to be Force-sensitive.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe citizens of the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium follow a rigid caste system in which their station in society is determined by the color of the scales they are born with. Among these, the brown-scaled outcasts are regarded as the lowest of the low, and have no place in the Imperium beyond menial labor or death at birth. Deeply xenophobic and religious, the Ssi-ruuk view the rest of the galaxy as populated by lesser beings whose worlds rightfully belong to the Imperium. Despite their fierce nature, most ssi-ruuk are afraid of dying on a world unconsecrated by their priest caste, as they believe their souls would be doomed, so they harvest and \"entech\" the life-energy of other species to power droids that fight for them. The entechment process is torturous and painful to its victims, and is the main power source of Ssi-ruuvi technology.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nSsi-ruuvi names are difficult to pronounce and gender neutral. Many ssi-ruuk adopt nicknames to make the lives of their associates easier. Ssi-ruuk do not have surnames.\r\n\r\n**Names.** Firwirrung, Ivpikkis, Sh'tk'ith, Th'twirirl, Yifaii\r\n\r\n### Ssi-Ruu Traits\r\nAs a ssi-ruu, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Ssi-ruuk reach adulthood in their early teens and live to between 100 and 120 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Ssi-ruuk's cultural drive to enslave and entech others cause them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Ssi-ruuk typically stand between 6 or 7 feet tall and weigh over 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.\r\n\r\n***Type.*** Your creature type is both beast and humanoid.\r\n\r\n***Force-Insensitive.*** While Ssi-ruuk can be manipulated by many force powers, they can not sense the Force. You can not use force powers or take levels in forcecasting classes.\r\n\r\n***Hunter.*** You are proficient in Survival.\r\n\r\n***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.\r\n\r\n***Natural Empathy.*** Ssi-ruuk have scent-tongues that let them read the emotions of individuals. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine emotions against humanoids and beasts within 10 feet of you.\r\n\r\n***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.\r\n\r\n***Thick Skin.*** You have tough, scaly skin and prefer not to wear clothes. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. \r\n\r\n***Tooth and Nail.*** Your fangs and claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Ssi-ruuvi.

Sullustans are distinguishable for their almond-shaped black eyes, facial jowls called dewflaps and large, round ears. Their wide earlobes provide excellent hearing, and their large eyes provide exceptional low-light vision. Due to their relative lack of exposure to natural light, Sullustans begin to suffer from corneal defects after 30 standard years. Many choose to wear special visors to prevent further damage. Some Sullustans tattoo their heads as a form of individual expression.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nSullustans are outgoing and mercantile, friendly and pragmatic. As a species they are altogether lacking in xenophobia. Though fond of practical jokes and extremely shrewd in their business dealings, they are eager to explore and travel the galaxy. Inquisitive by nature, some have described Sullustans as reckless, especially for their preference to learn and discover whenever possible through personal experience. Sullustans organize themselves into familial units known as Warren-clans. Each clan consists of one polyandrous female, several husbands, and their young. Unmated females, known as \"Fems\", are active members of their communities until they reach breeding status, called \"Ready\", when they choose their mates.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nMale names are typically longer than female names.

Talz have four eyes, which are also adaptations to their native environment. The larger set of eyes are shut during the day, when sunlight reflects off the snow with dazzling brightness\ufffdable to blind sensitive optical organs\ufffdleaving the smaller set to navigate with. Alternatively, during the deep darkness of their homeworld's moonless night, the larger pair are utilized to provide the Talz with adequate vision. Talz use a small proboscis to eat and communicate, creating high-pitched chirps and buzzes.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nTalz are a hunter-gatherer, clan-based society. They work in unison, and treat the entire clan as one single familial entity. Resources on Ordo Plutonia are often scarce, which leads to warring among Talz tribes. However, the clans are adept at forming a unified front when they face a common enemy.\r\n\r\nTalz are large, brutal creatures and are often used as guards and enforcers. Sometimes they are taken as slaves, though it's rare; they are rebellious against authority and don't take well to slavery. There are rumors that Talz are captured for scientific experimentation.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nTalz names are fairly gutteral and are characterized by their harsh nature. Female names are typically longer than male names. Surnames are clan-based, though it's rare that a Talz shares them with non-Talz.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Drak, Fedirk, Imom, Ke, Twift\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Ilnuno, Ontuga, Utrukk, Zimtucc\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Dic, Noetoc, Suptat, Wume, Zapak\r\n\r\n### Talz Traits\r\nAs a talz, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Talz reach adulthood at 10 and rarely live longer than 50 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Talz' peaceful and slow-to-anger nature cause them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Talz stand between 6 and 8 feet tall and weigh around 250 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\r\n\r\n***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Talzzi. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it. Talzzi is characterized by its high-pitched chirps and buzzes.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Tarasin\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Translucent; varies with emotion|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Red, orange, yellow, or black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Reptillian, sa'tosin spines|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'9\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |100 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Cularin|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Tarasinese|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nTarasins are tall reptilians covered in translucent scales that allows the species' color-changing skin below to show through. Tarasins also have a colorful fan of flesh and scales\ufffdknown as a kampo\ufffdthat opens around their heads when they experience strong emotional distress, which can be a detriment to negotiations, as it is difficult for a tarasin to hide discomfort. This color-changing ability is useful for camouflage and communication, and the scales naturally repel heat. Some examples of colors they take on include being brown when calm and in a comfortable environment, or becoming red after extended exertion or when excited. Tarasins also have short spines that protrude from their forearms\ufffdknown as a sa'tosin\ufffdwhich give the creatures the ability to sense the use of the Force. Tarasins are naturally curious and protective but also slow to anger. What they lack in sheer physical strength they make up for with a brilliant intellect.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nTarasins live in a tribal system in the jungle underbrush of Cularin, grouping together in clans called irstat. The tarasin believe they have a symbiotic relationship with Cularin, and their religion is based around the appreciation of the natural world. This closeness with their homeworld is what makes the tarasin reluctant to leave it for an extended time. The tarasin have a strong connection with the Force, and their spiritual leaders are often able to call upon the Force in small ways. The tarasin believe that the ch'hala tree is sacred. This may have been influenced by the trees having a similar ability to shift their colors as the tarasin, but it is also the most unique tree on Cularin. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nTarasin names are generally very soft and melodic. Names are agendered, and surnames are not used.\r\n\r\n**Names.** Feliosa, Misona, Nissira, Vylana, Ziransa\r\n\r\n### Tarasin Traits\r\nAs a tarasin, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Tarasins reach adulthood at 10 and live less than 80 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Tarasins' curious yet composed nature causes them to tend toward balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Tarasins typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 130 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Chameleon Skin.*** Your scales are translucent, allowing your color-shifting skin to help you blend into your surroundings. You have proficiency in the Stealth skill. Additionally, you can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.\r\n\r\n***Jungle Dweller.*** Growing up in the jungles of Cularin has left an impact. You don't treat jungle terrain as difficult terrain.\r\n\r\n***Naturalist.*** You have proficiency in the Nature skill.\r\n\r\n***Sa'tosin Sense.*** Tarasins have short spines called sa'tosin that allow them to sense the use of the Force. You are constantly under the effects of the force power *sense force*, though the power does not require concentration for you.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Tarasinese. You can communicate non-verbally with other tarasins through use of a complex system of skin color changes.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Taung\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> | | |\r\n> |:---|:---|\r\n> |***Skin Color***| Gray\r\n> |***Hair Color***| None\r\n> | ***Eye Color***| Yellow\r\n> |***Distinctions***| Bony and ridged skulls, tendrils  and fin-like protrusions on the back of their heads\r\n>___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> | | | |\r\n> |:---|:---:|:---:\r\n> |***Height*** | 5'8\"| +2d8\"\r\n> |***Weight***| 165 lb. | x(2d4) lb.\r\n>___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> | | |\r\n> |:---|:---|\r\n> |***Homeworld***| Coruscant, Mandalore (adopted)\r\n> |***Language***| Mando'a\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nTaung are a humanoid species of tall and strong sentient simians. Physically, the taung are extremely resilient and are able to endure hardships many other species are unable to, which benefits their warlike nature as well as their tendencies to conquer planets.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nTaung society is one steeped in war, and the taung are warriors above all else. Nomadic and clan-based, the taung greatly value strength and honor, with pragmatism and ruthlessness being common traits amongst them. Originally waging war as a means of ritual worship to their god Kad Ha'rangir, the taung eventually became the Mandalorians, and - under the leadership of Mandalore the Indomitable - the act of war itself became the center of Mandalorian worship, and to wage war is to *be* divine.\r\n\r\nDespite their volatile nature, the taung are far from primitive, and maintain a high priority in procuring the latest technological advancements whenever possible.\r\n\r\nThe Mandalorian armor that has become iconic throughout the galaxy originally began with the culture's taung founders, with their unique helmets and war masks being forged in the image of the taung's face, including slanted outer angles and a pointed chin. However, the armor is quite sparse among the taung as they believe that unarmed combat brings the highest honor.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nTaung names reflect their practical nature, typically choosing names that correspond to traits they deem desirable. Their names are rarely gender specific and can apply to either male or female. Their surnames reflect that of the clan they hail from.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Adenn (merciless), Atin (stubborn), Kot (strength), Kotep (brave), Tor (justice), Verd (soldier)\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Cadera, Fett, Keldau, Lok, Ordo, Vizla\r\n\r\n### Taung Traits\r\nAs a taung, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Taung reach adulthood at 13 and live to around 85, though they rarely live even half the length as they naturally can due to their deadly lifestyles as Mandalorians.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** The taung live by the traditions and honor-bound code of the Mandalorians, making them tend towards a lawful alignment, typically balanced or dark, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Taung typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 210 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Claws.*** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. \r\n\r\n***Relentless Endurance.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n***Taung Weapon Training.*** You gain proficiency in one vibroweapon and one blaster of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.\r\n\r\n***Force Insensitive.*** While taung can be manipulated by the force, they cannot sense the Force. You can not use force powers or take levels in forcecasting classes.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Mando'a. Mando'a is primarily a spoken language and is very expressive with simple grammar.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Theelin\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Variable|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Variable|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Variable|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Small horns, pale skin, colorful hair|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'8\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |95 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Unknown|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Galactic Basic|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe original appearance of the theelin is officially uncertain, as almost all known \"theelin\" are not full-blooded specimens, but hybrids. It is possible that some aspects of these individuals' appearances are not from their theelin genes, but from other near-human ancestors. Most, however, have vividly colored hair and pale skin, often mottled with colorful spots. Unfortunately, a series of mutations arose among later generations of theelin. These mutations have led to genetic incompatibilities within their species, making it impossible to produce offspring. Even attempts to continue their species by cross-breeding with other near-humans could not stop the theelin slide towards extinction, due to the high infant mortality rates such couplings suffer from. Theelin began inevitably dwindling in number\ufffdonly a few million theelin and part-theelin remain by the time the Republic fell, and pure theelin are presumed extinct by the fall of the Empire. Some of their greatest works are produced in these years, however, as an epitaph for a dying people. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nTheelin performers and artists created many of the galaxy's greatest works of art. The Theelin Divas, an all-female religious order, are recognized by many scholars of music as the greatest singers in the galaxy. Because of the rarity of the theelin, many female theelin and part-theelin are named \"Diva\" at birth, in hopes that they will develop the musical talent necessary to continue the traditions of the Diva order.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nTheelin use names similar to those in their community, typically human-similar names with exotic tinges.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Dhess, Gooti, J\ufffdnsone, Qylett\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** F\ufffdniss, Diva, Prystill, Saqua\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Joolie, Masozi, Oasay, Rellik\r\n\r\n### Theelin Traits\r\nAs a theelin, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Theelin reach adulthood in their late teens and live for about 70 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Theelin's good-nature and positivity despite the dour state of their species causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Theelin typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Expressive.*** You have proficiency in your choice of artist's implements, disguise kits, synthweaver's implements, or one musical instrument of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Performer.*** You have proficiency in the Performance skill.\r\n\r\n***Skill Versatility.*** You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one extra language of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Mutation.*** Theelin gain unique mutations, a result of cross-breeding with other humanoids. Choose one of the following mutations.\r\n___\r\n- **Balanced Hooves.** You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against being knocked prone.\r\n- **Darkvision.**  You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n- **Enhanced Senses.** Choose one from hearing, sight, or smell. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check related to the chosen sense, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.\r\n- **Heightened Reflexes.** Whenever you make a Dexterity ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to add 1d4 to the result. You can choose to do this after the check is rolled, but before the DM determines if you\ufffdve passed or failed the check. You cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n- **Unarmed Combatant.** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage and have the finesse property.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Thisspiasian\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Pale to green|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Black, blond, brown, grey, or white (with age)|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Yellow|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Four arms, serpentine, large beards|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'8\"|+2d8\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |250 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Thisspias|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Thisspiasian|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThisspiasians are easily recognized by their abundant beards and their long tails, which often reach over six feet. These tails are very strong and are commonly used to carry large objects. When meditating or at rest, a thisspiasian will coil their tail beneath their torso, reducing their height by several feet. They also possess four arms, with the upper set being stronger and larger. Each of their four hands have five fingers, and each finger is tipped with a long, sturdy claw. It is thought unsophisticated or unseemly by upper-class thisspiasians to have the bottom two visible in public, so they are generally hidden from sight via larger garments, with the smaller limbs sometimes even bound to their bodies. Thisspiasians need very little sleep to function normally, resting for only two hours a day, with brief meditative moments scattered throughout the day to refocus.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThisspiasian culture is one of proud warriors who keep their emotions well-concealed and their rages checked. Many outsiders see only a thisspiasian's outward facade of tranquility, and to most being it seems as if thisspiasians existed in a sea of calm. This is far from the truth, however, as they are in truth a very passionate species below the surface. A thisspiasian who doesn't meditate as often as they should will often be prone to otherwise atypical emotional outbursts.\r\n\r\nThisspias is ruled by a hereditary leader called the Blood Monarch. Due to their seemingly archaic ruling structure, thisspiasians are often considered out-of-touch. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nThisspiasian names typically are composed of two similar sounding syllables. Surnames are familial. \r\n\r\n**First Names.** Annak, Effed, Emmet, Gorro, Koto\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Albarn, Braibel, Kirsingr, Raledurn\r\n\r\n### Thisspiasian Traits\r\nAs a thisspiasian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Thisspiasians reach adulthood in their 20s and often live more than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Thisspiasians' emotional composure causes them to tend toward lawful alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Thisspiasians typically stand 5 to 6 and a half feet tall and generally weigh about 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Claws.*** Your claws are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Cultured.*** You have proficiency in the Lore skill.\r\n\r\n***Four-Armed.*** Thisspiasians have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).\r\n\r\n***Inscrutable.*** Your calm demeanor and control make you hard to read. Wisdom (Insight) checks made against you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on any saving throw against an effect that would read your thoughts.\r\n\r\n***Prehensile Tail.*** You have supreme control over your tail and can use it to manipulate objects as well as your hands. \r\n\r\n***Trance.*** You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Thisspiasian. Thisspiasian is a complex language characterized by its interlocking sentences and heavy use of sibilants.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Tiss'shar\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Varies|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Red, yellow, blue, purple|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Long necks, sharp teeth, colorful scales, tails|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'9\"|+2d8\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |100 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Tiss'sharl|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Tiss'shar|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nTiss'shar are bipedal therapods descended from predatory reptilians native to the humid jungle continents of Tiss'sharl. They are relatively strong and agile, with long necks, slender torsos, wider hips, and a short but wiry tail. Their mouths are filled with short, sharp teeth, and their large tongues are pink and constantly moving. Their large eyes appear glassy as a result of the clear, resilient film that covered and protected them. Many tiss'shar have prominent sickle-shaped claws on the first toe of their feet; some also possessed a crest of feathers atop their heads.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nTiss'shar social structure is inextricably tied to business. Nearly all tiss'shar families have a corporation as a patron, which provides the family with its material needs in exchange for the dedicated labor of its members. Patron corporations regularly supply food, housing, health care, education, and security services. The predatory instincts of the tiss'shar, redirected into the realm of business, often serve them well. While no stereotype fully defines the species, they often were considered aggressive, resourceful, calculating businessbeings. These traits also made them excellent assassins and gunfighters, renowned galaxywide for their efficiency. Most tiss'shar had an appreciation for the art of the deal, and conducted their business legitimately; even those who chose the path of the assassin remembered that they were conducting business and respected their contracts.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nTiss'shar names are segmented, with males receiving an additional \"tail name.\" Surnames always come last.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Si-Di-Ri, Tra-Skan-Lor, Geor-Dan-Thi \r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Von-Ra, Ura-Vaza, Shu-Xangiz, Sav-Lork\r\n\r\n### Tiss'shar Traits\r\nAs a tiss'shar, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Strength, Intelligence, or Charisma score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Tiss'shar reach adulthood in their early teens and live about 80 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Tiss'shar's moral flexibility causes them to tend towards balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Tiss'shar typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\ufffdt discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Predatory Talents.*** You have proficiency in one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, or Technology.\r\n\r\n***Surprise Attack.*** If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it. You can use this trait only once per combat.\r\n\r\n***Tooth and Nail.*** Your sharp teeth and claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage. Lastly, as a bonus action, you can perform a special bite attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Tiss'shar. Tiss'shar is mainly formed of hisses, shrieks, and lisping vocalizations. As a written language, it has a violent-looking calligraphy of curves and sharp lines.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Tognath\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Tan or cream|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |White|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Breathing apparatus, endo and exoskeletons|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'5\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |105 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Yar Togna|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Tognath|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nTognath are a sentient species native to Yar Togna. Yar Togna is a foul-smelling, high-gravity planet with a toxic, fume-saturated atmosphere. As a result, tognath wear a breathing apparatus to process the oxygen content in a planet's atmosphere. The tognath have a striking look thanks to their insectoid and mammalian characteristics; another factor is their having both an endo- and exoskeleton. They also possess a very primitive nervous system, which provides them with immunity to most pain (a helpful trait in combat). Tognath begin life as larvae born from egg clutches hatched in a suspension jelly, and latch onto one of their parents, feeding directly from their bloodstream. While in that jelly, two or more eggs (not necessarily from the same parent) sometimes graft together, thus creating a bond that continues throughout the life of the eggmates. Six months later, parents visit a nursery tree, where the young detatch from them and spin a cocoon. Within, the offspring undergo a metamorphosis, developing both their skeletons to resist the high gravity and pressures of Yar Togna.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nTognath live in stilted homes with lava channels near the main mountain range of Yar Togna, where they have access to mountain springwater. Most of tognath society believes that mate selection and egg laying should occur late in life, after having dedicated most of one's prime years to a career. This means that parents are generally retired and dote on their children relentlessly, often homeschooling them after their transformation. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nTognath use generally simple, nongendered names, without bothering with surnames.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Darjia, Essec, Irion, Tathak\r\n\r\n### Tognath Traits\r\nAs a tognath, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores increase by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Tognath reach adulthood by 10 and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Tognath are famously dedicated and hard workers, causing them to tend towards balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Tognath typically stand 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Crafters.*** You have proficiency with one set of artisan's implements of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Exoskeleton.*** You have a thick exoskeleton. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n***Foreign Biology.*** You cannot breathe oxygen. The tognath have created a breathing apparatus to negate the negative effects of living in an oxygen rich environment, but if your mask is removed while you are in such an environment, you lose consciousness.\r\n\r\n***Life in the Void.*** You have resistance to necrotic damage, and while exposed to the vacuum of space, you can survive for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 hour), instead of a number of rounds.\r\n\r\n***Primitive Nerves.*** Because of their primitive nervous systems, tognath are immune to most pain, letting them shrug off major injuries. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. Once you've used this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Vocalizer.*** Tognath vocal cords are not made for oxygen rich environments, and rely on a vocalizer to communicate effectively with other species. If your vocalizer is removed or destroyed, your voice becomes quiet and difficult to understand.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Tognath. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Togorian\r\n> ___\r\n>##### Visual Characteristics\r\n> | | |\r\n> |:---|:------------|\r\n> |***Skin Color***| Black, brown, or white|\r\n> |***Hair Color***| Black, brown, orange, or white|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|Brown, green, orange, or yellow|\r\n> |***Distinctions***&emsp;|Large frame, retractable claws, striped fur, rigid honor code|\r\n> ___\r\n> ##### Physical Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n> |:---|:------------:|:------------:|\r\n> |  ***Height*** |6'2\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |  ***Weight*** |175 lb.|x(2d6) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n>##### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> |||\r\n> |:---|:------------|:------------:|\r\n> |***Homeworld***| Togoria |\r\n> |***Language***| Togorese |\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe Togorian people are a feline warrior species native to the planet Togoria. They are large, heavy-framed bipeds, with retractable claws on their hands and feet. Female Togorians grow up to 7 feet tall, while adult males can reach up to 9 feet. They're covered in gray-white, black, brown, or orange fur, often with colorful spots or stripes. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nTogorians have a unique cultural division between their sexes. They evolved as nomadic hunters of creatures like the bist and etelo, surviving on the wilderness as apex predators. As time went on, a rift in their society developed between the two sexes. Males were drawn to continue their lifestyle as nomads and hunters for their people, while females tended to prefer remaining in permanent camps and contributed the vast majority of their species technological developments. This division has continued into modern times, with males continuing their nomadic traditions and females frequently preferring to stay in villages and cities. Males visit their mates for about a month each year, but otherwise the sexes live completely separate lives. Whether in spite of this separation of the sexes, or because of it, Togorians are typically monogamous and devoted to their chosen mates.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nTogorian names tend to be short and primal-sounding. Female names tend to include softer consonants and more vowels, while male names are typically harsher. Togorians do not use surnames.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.**  Mezgraf, Mlatar, Morto, Mrrov, Torr\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Coelle, Elotis, H'sishi, Kra'ake, Rrowv\r\n\r\n### Togorian Traits\r\nAs a togorian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity or Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n**Age.** Togorian reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n**Alignment.** Togorians' rigid sense of honor causes them to tend toward lawful light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n**Size.** Togorians tower over almost all other species, with smaller females standing upwards of 7 feet tall and weighing 250 lbs., while males can easily reach 8 feet tall and weigh around 350 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Claws.*** Your claws are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n**Savage Attacks.** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.\r\n\r\n**Stealthy Hunter.** You have proficiency in the Survival and Stealth skills.\r\n\r\n**Toughness.** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.\r\n \r\n**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Togorese.

While their stubby legs can support their body weight, Toydarians' primary mode of locomotion was their use of the wings on their upper back. Though their wings can beat as fast as ten times a second, the effort burned up large amounts of energy, causing the species to need to replenish itself often through regularly eating mass quantities of food. In order to fuel this hyperactive metabolism, Toydarians eat concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Most of the bloodiest wars in their history were fought over food supplies. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nDespite being ruled by the Hutts, the Toydarian people are able to govern themselves free of major outside intervention through the establishment of a feudal monarchy. A ruling king sits on the planet's throne, allowing vassals to form allegiances and have minor disputes to solve their own problems. The king makes sure to keep his vassals happy and to have their allegiance, but will occasionally encourage infighting to reveal the true character of the vassals and weed out treachery. \r\n\r\nToydarians are known as shrewd businessmen.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nToydarian names are fairly simple and guttural, but a few harsher elements can be found here and there. Male names are generally shorter than female names. Female names always end in a vowel. \r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Dod, Nesteddo, Tul, Zloomroo\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Fefiffe, Lenlibo, Nugni, Zoldibu\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Daab, Faabb, Kepo, Mitra, Vulba\r\n\r\n### Toydarian Traits\r\nAs a toydarian, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Toydarians reach adulthood at 10 and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Toydarians' greedy nature causes them to tend toward chaotic balanced, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Toydarians average 4 feet tall and weigh less than 50 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Business Savvy.*** A common trait of all Toydarians is their shrewd business sense and their ability to haggle any deal. A loyal and proud people, these traits could be off-putting to outsiders, as many Toydarians in the galaxy were seen as crooks or slimy businessmen, but this was not always the case. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.\r\n\r\n***Closed Mind.*** Toydarian brains have an unusual composition which made them resistant to influence from the Force. You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.\r\n\r\n***Flight.*** You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. While wearing medium or heavy armor, your flying speed is reduced by half.\r\n\r\n***Shrewd Demeanor.*** You have proficiency in two Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skills of your choice.\r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields. Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, Huttese, and Toydarian.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Ugnaught\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Varying shades of pink|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|White|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Black and red|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Diminutive stature, porcine features, technological affinity|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|3'1\"|+2d12\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|40 lb.|x1 lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Gentes|\r\n> |***Language***|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Ugnaught|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nUgnaughts are diminutive, porcine humanoids who have pink skin, upturned noses, white hair, and thick layers of jowls.

They notably eat genteslugs.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nUgnaughts are ruled by councils comprised of elected officers. Ugnaughts live their lives in accordance to their \"blood profession\", with Ugnaught parents teaching their children their trade. Infant Ugnaughts are known as Ugletts. If the number of new Ugnaughts in a given profession exceeds the need, a blood duel is called. When the Ugnaughts reached their twentieth year of age, these fights are held to the death, with the victor winning the right to inherit their blood profession. Despite this outdated and violent custom, the Ugnaughts are generally a peaceful people with a rich culture.\r\n\r\nWhen greeting an Ugnaught, it is advised to bow silently, then wait for a guttural purring as a positive response. Usage of the common galactic greeting \"yaa-yaah\" is considered a personal insult to Ugnaughts. If this occurrs, it was advisable to duck and cover, as various mechanical implements will be thrown one's way. \r\n\r\nUgnaughts are often enslaved as they are fairly meek.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nUgnaught names are generally concise. Female names sound more cheerful. Surnames are determined by blood profession.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Banax, Dral, Durn, Togre, Yirkux\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Admeva, Olnito, Ruskor, Vurlilli\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Col, Gnatro, Mikk, Roc, Sag\r\n\r\n### Ugnaught Traits\r\nAs an ugnaught, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Ugnaughts reach adulthood at 20 and can live to reach 200.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Ugnaughts tend toward no particular alignment.

When you reach 3rd level, you learn and can cast the *analyze* tech power once per day. When you reach 5th level, you learn and can cast the *overheat* tech power once per day. Your techcasting ability is Intelligence. You do not require use of a wristpad for these powers.\r\n\r\n***Tinker.*** You have proficiency with tinker's implements. You can use these and spend 1 hour and 100 cr worth of materials to construct a Tiny Device (AC 5, 1 hp). You can take the Use an Object action to have your device cause one of the following effects: create a small explosion, create a repeating loud noise for 1 minute, create smoke for 1 minute, cause harmless tremors for 1 minute. You can maintain a number of these devices up to your proficiency bonus at once, and a device stops functioning after 24 hours away from you. You can dismantle the device to reclaim the materials used to create it.\r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields.

Considered exotic for being one of the few sentient species to fall outside the standard classificiations of birds, mammals, etc. Their bodies consist of cytoplasm, which can vary in colors and shade, bound by a slime-coated membrane. Being amorphic, ugors can assume nearly any shape, and can exude pseudopodia limbs such as crude arms, mouths, and sensory organs, although a globular form was the most comfortable and easy to maintain. Due to their unique physiology and evolution, they are able to digest substances that would prove toxic to other species, and can subsist on other species' trash. While most maintain globular form, some who interact with humanoid species will wear EVA suits or armor to give themselves a humanoid appearence. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nUgor society revolves around trading and scavenging; they are famed for providing equipment to nascent civilizations and for salvaging wreckage from failed ones. The beings are supremely adaptable and astutely able to get what they want from others. Ugor business deals are extremely complex, incorporating opaque knots of loans, interest, and payment plans. Ugors have an intense love of trash, which they base their religions off, and excel at those skills that are useful in their pursuit of rubbish collection: a member of the species' education emphasizes skills related to scavenging and starship operation (although members of the species rarely became more than passable pilots).\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nUgor names typically consisted of two parts, with no notable difference between the genders. Ugor do not use surnames.\r\n\r\n**Names.** ArrGack, GrrKack, SplrMuck\r\n\r\n### Ugor Traits\r\nAs an ugor, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.***  Ugors reach adulthood in their early teens and live about 70 years, though some live to be over 100.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Ugors are loyal to their theocratic state and see outsiders as expendable. Many follow a Lawful Balanced alignment, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Ugors typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 130 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Amorphous Form.*** You can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide, provided you are wearing and carrying nothing.

Their homeworld, Umbara, is situated deep within the Ghost Nebula, and receives almost no direct light from the planet's primary star. As a result, Umbaran eyes are well-adjusted to seeing in low light, and can see into the ultraviolet spectrum, but can be disoriented by bright light.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nUmbaran society is strictly divided into a leveled caste system, with most Umbarans constantly scheming to improve their social rank, using tactics such as blackmail, subterfuege, and even assassination if necessary. Only those within the ten highest caste tiers were given opportunities to leave their homeworld. Because of the cutthroat machinations required to get there, Umbarans in the wider galaxy are known as skilled, ruthless politicians. This reputation is enhanced by the Umbarans' talents for reading and influencing the emotions of others.\r\n\r\nUmbara developed its own technological advances separate from galactic society, and possessed technology that was in many fields far more advanced than the galactic standard. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nUmbaran names are typically no more than one or two syllables.

The male Voss have blue skin and bright orange eyes, while the females have red skin and azure eyes. The Voss do not have hair or distinct pupils, and posess unique patterns of markings on their face, neck, and body, a trace of their shared ancestry with Gormak. Their voices have a slight mechanical tinge to them, making them sound somewhat like a droid or machine. Voss undogo a physical, developmental change during their marriage ceremonies (known as the Rite of Ardor) and do not develop sexually prior to the performance of these rituals.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nThe Voss species resides in the isolated mountain-top city of Voss-Ka and is vastly outnumbered on their homeworld by its other native sentient species, the Gormak, who are extremely hostile toward them and from whom they arose. Most Voss live peacefully in Voss-Ka, caring for their families, cultivating the wild plants and maintaining equipment for the Voss commandos in the war against the Gormak, although some Voss do live outside the capital city, such as the Voss Mystics who reside in the Shrine of Healing. The Voss are great lovers of art, and their architecture features a distinctive artistic style. The entire Voss society is guided by the Force visions of Voss Mystics, which are considered infallible without exception.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nAll Voss have two short names, connected by a hyphen, with the family name being the second one.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Char, Edan, Fadith, Nodin, Orin\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Amin, Magra, Tala, Weylin, Yana\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** -Ko, -La, -Po, -Rae, -Va\r\n\r\n### Voss Traits\r\nAs a voss, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Voss reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

They are tall, reptilian humanoids with bulbous dark eyes and sweeping head crests. Their hands and feet have three digits each, one of which was opposable. They have distinguishing gray-green, leathery skin. Being able to breathe both water and air, they are perfectly adapted to travel Sembla's warm, shallow seas dotted with volcanic islands. They share a strong nomadic instinct with their amphibious ancestors.  \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nYoung Vurk males are married off by their parents; those who failed to marry before reaching adulthood remain bachelors for the rest of their lives. Because their way of living resulted in virtually no sizable permanent settlement whatsoever, Vurks were generally considered primitive by the rest of the galaxy; however, that was not true. They are very intelligent and believe in a highly developed philosophical tradition that emphasizes personal integrity and individual freedom and encourage personal honesty. Their compassionate and calm manner made them better than average diplomats.\r\n\r\nVurks are very family-oriented. It is common for multiple generations to remain in the same location as a single household, with the eldest family member being the patriarch or matriarch and making the decision for the entire family.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nVurk names are traditionally two to three syllables. Female names typically end with a vowel, while male names vary. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Coleman, Jadran, Milanko, Zlatko\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Elka, Iryna, Miglena, Tanya, Verka\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Cheevochik, Provric, Trebor, Vorgecz\r\n\r\n### Vurk Traits\r\nAs a vurk, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Vurk reach adulthood in their 20s and live an average of 70 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Vurk philosophies cause them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Vurks typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 175 lbs.

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Head Crest.*** Your head crest is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Semblan.

Almond-shaped eyes dominate a small head perched atop a long neck. Their brain is split between two parts of their body; the part located in the skull controls primitive emotions and basic body functions, while another portion in their chest controls higher functions such as creative thinking and logic. It's believed that xexto's body structure and lightning-fast reflexes developed to help them escape predators while pursuing their own prey, there is no question that genetic manipulation forever altered their evolutionary development.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nAlthough the Old Republic had long since outlawed experimentation on sentient beings, unscrupulous arkanian geneticists continued to search for primitive sentients on distant planets as fodder for their experiments. One such group found the xexto's forbears- a society of loosely organized hunter-gatherer tribes taking shelter in the trees of Troiken. Independently, they developed technologically advanced civilizations, and were on the verge of attaining interstellar travel when Republic scouts contacted them. Difficult terrain and dangerous predators found on their homeworld have led many Xexto to admire and encourage risk-taking. Despite their thrillseeking nature and willingness to take risks, xexto are generally well mannered and even-tempered. Questioning a Xexto's bravery is one way to make him or her angry. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nXexto have very unique names, often sounding odd to outsiders. Surnames are familiar but optional.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Babading, Cicity, Gastoro, Maila, Qinla\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Cherum, Hevad, Qatabas, Riived, Serap\r\n\r\n### Xexto Traits\r\nAs a xexto, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Xexto reach adulthood at 9 and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Despite being avid thrillseekers, xexto are calm and even tempered, tending them towards balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Xexto typically stand 3 to 5 feet tall and generally weigh about 50 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\r\n\r\n***Dexterous.*** You have proficiency in one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Piloting, or Sleight of Hand.\r\n\r\n***Fearless.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\r\n\r\n***Four-Armed.*** Xexto have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).\r\n\r\n***Jungle Dweller.*** Growing up in the rainforests of Troiken has left an impact. You don\ufffdt treat jungle terrain as difficult terrain.\r\n\r\n***Racer's Reflexes.*** Whenever you make a Dexterity ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to add 1d4 to the result. You cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Split Mind.*** When you make a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the roll. Once you've done so, you must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again.\r\n\r\n***Treeclimber.*** You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You have advantage on Strength ability checks and saving throws that involve climbing.\r\n\r\n***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons.

Xextese is a blubbering sort of language, with many metaphors for natural phenomenon found in its vocabulary.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Yevetha\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Green or yellow|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Black|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Retractable dewclaws, six fingers|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'2\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |105 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |N'zoth|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Yevethan|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nPhysically, the Yevetha are tall beings with a ghoulish appearance that is bereft of any body hair, being described as being so gaunt as to seem skeletal due to their pallid gray skin and lithe builds. The species possesses six fingered hands that have retractable dewclaws. Each one is located on the inside of the wrist above their six-fingered hands. Their dewclaws shoot from a sheath of a skin beneath their cadaverous hands and are capable of being retracted. When extended fully, the wrist blades reach about a foot in length, and are used in close combat and blood sacrifices. The Yevetha also possess a greater tolerance for g-forces when compared to Human pilots.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nWithin their society, blood is an important aspect of their culture and is a central focus of their religious belief system. This has resulted in them becoming a particularly violent species. For the Yevetha, death is not to be feared. They are described as being dutiful, attentive, cautious but also fatalistic in their view of the universe. When fighting against other foes, Yevetha are notable for being ruthless fighters who never surrender even in the face of certain defeat. Due to the brutal nature of their society, the Yevetha do not possess a single jail, penitentiary or stockade as they believe there is no need for such facilities. In fact, they do not possess a word in their language for either convict or incarcerate.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nYevetha names are sharp and are kept to one syllable, not varying significantly based on gender. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**First Names.** Ral, Var, Cax, Tav, Fol, Sip, Nov\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Faalk, Naalar, Giinn, Ralle, Xoota\r\n\r\n### Yevetha Traits\r\nAs a yevetha, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Yevetha reach adulthood in their early teens and live less than a century.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Yevetha's xenophobic attitude causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Yevetha typically stand between 6 and 6 and a half feet tall and generally weigh about 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.\r\n\r\n***Arm Blades.*** Your retractable dewclaws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n***Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. \r\n\r\n***Mechanical Memory.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check related to memorizing or duplicating mechanical readouts, you are considered to have expertise in the Technology skill.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Yevethan. Yevetha are able to speak other languages, but their isolationist nature makes them tend to reject the languages of other species. Only rarely would a Yevethan speak Galactic Basic, as this would often decrease their social standing. \r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Zeltron\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Light pink to deep crimson|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Blue, brown, pink, or red|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Hazel, silver, amber|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Capable of producing powerful pheromones|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |4'8\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |90 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Zeltros|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Galactic Basic|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nZeltrons are one of the few near-human species that differentiated from the baseline stock enough to be considered a new species of the Human genus, rather than simply a subspecies. They possess two biological traits of note. The first is that they all produce potent pheromones, similar to the Falleen species, which enhanced their attractiveness and likeability. The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others; some Zeltrons have been hired by the Exchange for this ability. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure are very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nZeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general. Most of their art and literature is devoted to the subject, producing some of the raciest pieces in the galaxy. Zeltrons are known to dress in wildly colorful or revealing attire. It's common to see Zeltrons wearing shockingly bright shades of neon colors in wildly designed bikinis, or nearly skin tight clothing of other sorts with bizarre color designs, patterns, and symbols. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nZeltron names often have an air of mystique to them, to evoke sensuality. For a Zeltron, a beautiful face is nothing without an equally beautiful name. It's not uncommon for a Zeltron to forsake their familial surname in favor of a more attractive-sounding one.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Marruc, Bahb, Rahulh, Demagol \r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Lyshaa, Dani, Vianna, Chantique \r\n\r\n**Surnames.** D'Pow, Blue, Duare, Sapphire\r\n\r\n### Zeltron Traits\r\nAs a zeltron, you have the following special traits.\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Zeltron reach adulthood in their late teens and live about 80 years.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Zeltron are a deeply sensual, hedonistic species, causing them to tend toward chaotic balanced or dark side alignments, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Zeltron tend to be slender and statuesque, typically standing between 5 and 6 feet tall and rarely weighing more than 150 lb. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\n***Charismatic.*** You have proficiency with Deception or Persuasion (your choice). \r\n\r\n***Enthralling Pheromones.*** You can use your pheromones to influence individuals of both sexes. Whenever you roll a 1 on a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Additionally, once per short or long rest, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower on a Charisma check as a 10. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n***Natural Empathy.*** Zeltron's limited telepathy allow them to sense mood shifts in those around them. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine emotions against humanoids and beasts within 10 feet of you.\r\n\r\n***Two Livered.*** Zeltron have two livers, which makes them adept at filtering toxins. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one language of your choice.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Zilkin\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Green|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |None|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Turquoise|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Four-fingered hands, three-toed feet, stalk eyes|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |1'0\"|+2d6\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |3 lbs. |x1 lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Zilk|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Zilkin|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe zilkins are a bipedal, amphibious species discernible by their diminutive stature and stalk eyes. Their homeworld, Zilk, has many dense jungles and swamps deemed impossible to navigate by most species. Only the zilkins themselves, evolved from worm-like creatures, were able to easily slip through the gaps in the tangled, coarse foliage. Their powerful legs make them adept at swimming and leaping.\r\n\r\nZilkin also have bulbous chins which inflate with excess air while they are speaking.\r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nTheir short lifespans cause zilkins to be one of the fastest learners in the galaxy, capable of learning in weeks what takes other species months. Zilkins live in large communities woven into the thick clumps of trees on Zilk. Whenever a dispute occurs, zilkins turn to a ritualistic form of debate where everyone affected voices their opinion on the matter. Whoever croaks their views the loudest and most confidently, wins. As a result, zilkins tend to be quite opinionated.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, the zilkins remained unknown to the galaxy at large, simply because few individuals had any interest in visiting Zilk, let alone exploring its notoriously impenetrable jungles. Having lived in isolation for so many generations, and often mocked for their size, zilkins tend to exhibit cantankerous behavior toward other species. Despite this, a number of zilkins leave their homeworld and take an active role in galactic politics, gaining the planet representation in the Senate.\r\n\r\n### Names\r\nZilkin names are usually clear and concise. Surnames are familial.\r\n\r\n**Male Names.** Belip, Jegg, Meebur, Ponix\r\n\r\n**Female Names.** Fula, Nili, Sia, Vo\r\n\r\n**Surnames.** Bestrein, Cruu, Odebre, Telvet\r\n\r\n### Zilkin Traits\r\nAs a zilkin, you have the following special traits:\r\n\r\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.\r\n\r\n***Age.*** Zilkin are considered adults at 4 years old, and rarely live to be over 12.\r\n\r\n***Alignment.*** Zilkin have an outspoken but just nature that causes them to tend towards lawful light side, though there are exceptions.\r\n\r\n***Size.*** Zilkin stand between 1 and 2 feet tall and weigh around 10 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Tiny.\r\n\r\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 20 feet.\r\n\r\n***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.\r\n\r\n***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underwater, you have superior vision in low light conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n***Pintsized.*** Your tiny stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use medium or heavy shields. Additionally, you can't wield weapons with the two-handed or versatile property, and you can only wield one-handed weapons in two hands unless they have the light property.\r\n\r\n***Puny.*** Zilkin are too small to pack much of a punch. You have disadvantage on Strength saving throws, and when determining your bonus to attack and damage rolls for weapon attacks using Strength, you can't add more than +3. \r\n\r\n***Quick Learner.*** When using downtime for learning a new language or training with a set of tools, it takes half the amount of time and credits necessary to complete.\r\n\r\n***Small and Nimble.*** You are too small and fast to effectively target. You have a +1 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.\r\n\r\n***Strong-Legged.*** When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier.\r\n\r\n***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 20 feet.\r\n\r\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Zilkin. Zilkin is characterized by loud, croaking noises from the throat, supported by air stored in the chin.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Zygerrian\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Visual Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--|\r\n> |***Skin Color***|  |Light tones|\r\n> |***Hair Color***|  |Black, brown, gray, or red|\r\n> |***Eye Color***|  |Blue or yellow|\r\n> |***Distinctions***|  |Large pointed ears, clawed hands, fur-covered faces, bony facial spurs|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***|  |5'1\"|+2d8\"|\r\n> |***Weight***|  |120 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Sociocultural Characteristics\r\n> ||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--\r\n> |***Homeworld***|  |Zygerria|\r\n> |***Language***|  |Zygerrian|\r\n\r\n### Biology and Appearance\r\nThe Zygerrians are a bipedal, sentient humanoid species. Feline in appearance, the species possesses strong, angular features, with long fangs jutting from their jaws and claws extending from their hands. The Zygerrians' faces and their pointed ears are almost entirely covered with fur; males usually have more hair than females, with bands of fur growing on their cheeks. Male Zygerrians also display a number of bony spurs protruding from the chin, which females typically lack. Zygerrians usually have sallow complexions and are physically strong, but some suffer from obesity. \r\n\r\n### Society and Culture\r\nA warlike species, the Zygerrians hold strength\ufffdboth physical and mental\ufffdin great esteem, viewing it as a means to gain power and authority. They believe that it is the natural order of life for the strong to dominate the weak, so slavery is normal for the species, and a display of weakness could mean death or enslavement in their culture. Those who become their slaves are viewed as inferior by the Zygerrians.\r\n\r\nZygerrian society is organized into clans and classes. They have a noble class, many members of which, despite their high status, pursue a career in the military. The Zygerrian government is a monarchy; female rulers hold the title of Queen, and males are addressed as Kings.\r\n\r\nThe center of the Zygerrian society is the Zygerrian Slavers Guild, which focuses on the slave trade in the Outer Rim Territories. \r\n\r\n### Names\r\nZygerrian names are rather diverse, though shorter names are the most common.

The creature makes its initiative check with advantage.\r\n\r\n#### Aid Droid\r\n_1st-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action\r\n- **Range:** 60 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nChoose one droid or construct that you can see within range. The target can immediately use its reaction to regain hit points equal to 1d6 + your techcasting ability modifier.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.\r\n\r\n#### Alter Self\r\n*2nd-level tech power*\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour\r\n\r\nYou alter your form with tech. When you cast the power, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the power. While the power lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.\r\n\r\n***Aquatic Adaptation.*** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.\r\n\r\n***Change Appearance.*** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species (an organic species cannot appear as a droid, or vice versa), though none of your statistics change. You can also alter your vocal cords, enabling you to speak a language you know, but otherwise would be incapable of speaking. You also can\u2019t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you\u2019re bipedal, you can\u2019t use this power to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the power, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.\r\n\r\n***Natural Weapons.*** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your damage die for your unarmed strikes increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8). Your unarmed strikes are considered enhanced and you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with them.\r\n\r\n#### Barrage\r\n_1st-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 120 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nYou launch 4d6 tiny projectiles at up to four creatures you can see within range. The projectiles can be divided between the targets as desired. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 1 kinetic damage per projectile, or half as much damage on a successful save.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you launch an additional 1d6 projectiles and can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.\r\n\r\n#### Burst of Flame\r\n_2nd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Self (30-foot line)\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nYou expel a burst of flame in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, originating from you. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\r\n\r\n#### Construct Droid\r\n_2nd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 minute\r\n- **Range:** 10 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\r\n\r\nYou construct a droid, which is deployed in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This droid uses the Constructed Droid stat block. When you cast the power, choose a design: Probe, Pyro, or Battle. The droid resembles a Class IV droid, and the design determines certain traits in its stat block. The droid falls to pieces and disintegrates when it drops to 0 hit points or when the power ends.\r\n\r\nThe droid is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the droid shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your commands you issue through your tech focus (no action required). If you don\u2019t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.\r\n\r\nThe droid is a valid target for the _tracker droid interface_ power. If that power is cast targeting the constructed droid, it only takes 1 minute to synchronize with the droid.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, use the higher level wherever the power\u2019s level appears in the stat block.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Constructed Droid\r\n>_Medium droid, unaligned_\r\n> ___\r\n> - **Armor Class** 11 + the level of the power (natural armor)\r\n> - **Hit Points** 20 (Probe only) or 30 (Pyro and Battle only) + 10 for each slot level above 2nd\r\n> - **Speed** 30 ft.

Hit: 1d6 + 3 + the power's level energy damage.\r\n> ***Vibroweapon. (Battle Only)*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your tech attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d12 + 3 + the power's level kinetic damage.\r\n> ***Flamethrower. (Pyro Only)*** The droid shoots a stream of flame from itself in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = your tech save DC). On a failure, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage + 1d8 fire damage for each power level above 2nd. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage. This cannot be used with Multiattack.\r\n\r\n#### Cryogenic Blow\r\n_1st-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nThe next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack during this power's duration, the attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage to the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it gains a level of slowed for the duration. At the start of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** If you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.\r\n\r\n#### Delayed Detonator\r\n_1st-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 60 feet\r\n- **Duration:** 1 round\r\n\r\nChoose a point you can see within range. You launch a detonator at that point, which remains there until the start of your next turn, when it explodes, ending the power. You can also use your reaction at any point during the power's duration to cause the detonator to explode early. When the detonator explodes, each creature within 5 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d8 fire damage and 1d8 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you can launch an additional detonator at another point you can see within range for each slot level above 1st. The detonators all explode simultaneously. A creature in the area of more than one detonator when they explode is only affected once.\r\n\r\n#### Detonator\r\n_At-will tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 60 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nYou launch a detonator at a creature. Make a ranged tech attack against a creature you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 fire damage, and each creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 fire damage.\r\n\r\nThis power's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d6/2d4), 11th level (3d6/3d4), and 17th level (4d6/4d4).\r\n\r\n#### Disassemble\r\n_7th-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Touch\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nOne constructed object up to 100 lbs. in weight that you touch falls to pieces, separating into its component parts. For instance, a vibrosword separates into a blade, handle, oscillator, and guard, while a hovercart collapses into a repulsor engine, bolts, and metal panels. If the object is being worn, carried, or operated by a creature, the creature can make an Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the item is unaffected.\r\n\r\n#### Dismantle\r\n_At-will tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** Special\r\n- **Range:** Touch\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nYou break or tear an unenhanced structure or object you touch that is not being worn or carried by a creature other than you. The break or tear can be up to 1 foot in any dimension. When cast this in this way, this power has a casting time of 1 minute.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can touch a droid or construct when you cast this power. Make a melee tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 energy damage. When cast in this way, this power has a casting time of 1 action.\r\n\r\nThis power\u2019s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).\r\n\r\n#### Fabricate\r\n_4th-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes\r\n- **Range:** 10 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n \r\nYou convert raw materials into products of the same material.\r\nFor example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from bantha hide.\r\n\r\nChoose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the power is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.\r\n\r\nCreatures or enhanced items can't be created by this power. You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of tool used to craft such objects.\r\n\r\n#### Fabricate Minor Trap\r\n_1st-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 minute\r\n- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius sphere)\r\n- **Duration:** 24 hours, or until triggered\r\n\r\nYou ward a 30-foot radius sphere centered on you with a manually-operated trap. The trap is well disguised. Any creature that can\u2019t see the area at the time the power is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your tech save DC to notice the trap before entering the area. Once after this power is cast, when a creature you can see enters or moves within the warded area, you can use your reaction to trigger the trap. The effect on the creature depends on the kind of trap you employ, which you choose when you cast this power. You can maintain a maximum number of instances of this power at once equal to your techcasting ability modifier.\r\n\r\n***Blaster.*** This power creates a blaster turret which fires at the target when triggered. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.\r\n\r\n***Pitfall.*** This power creates a 5-foot diameter, 15-foot deep pitfall in the ground beneath the creature when triggered, which must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature falls into the pitfall. On a success, the creature falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the pitfall. This pitfall cannot be created through manufactured terrain. Otherwise, the hole is well constructed and lasts even after the power's duration. Flying creatures avoid this trap.\r\n\r\n***Snare.*** This power creates a snare of rope, wire, vine, or webs that entangle the creature. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 kinetic damage and is restrained until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and ends its movement.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the effects increase, based on the trap.\r\n*Blaster.* The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st. If cast using a slot of 3rd level or higher, this power targets creatures in a sphere centered on the triggering creature within the warded area, the radius of which is 5 feet for every two slot levels above 1st.\r\n*Pitfall.* The depth of the pitfall increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st. If cast using a slot of 3rd level or higher, the diameter of the pit is 5 feet wider for every two slot levels above 1st.\r\n*Snare.* The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. If cast using a slot of 3rd level or higher, Large creatures no longer have advantage on their saving throw. This size category increases for every two slot levels above 1st.\r\n\r\n#### Greater Energy Shield\r\n_2nd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a creature you can see within range is hit by an attack or targeted by the *homing rockets* power\r\n- **Range:** 15 feet\r\n- **Duration:** 1 round\r\n\r\nAn energy shield appears and protects the target. Until the start of the target's next turn, the target has a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and the target takes no damage from *homing rockets*.\r\n\r\n#### Instant Translocation\r\n_3rd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nYour form shimmers in a holographic configuration and collapses as an attack begins to hit you. You have a +5 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. As part of the same reaction, you can then teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you, and can make one weapon attack with advantage against the attacker.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the maximum teleport distance increases by 10 for each slot level above 3rd.\r\n\r\n#### Irradiate\r\n_2nd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 120 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nA surge of radiation washes over a creature within range. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage and suffers one level of exhaustion, which lasts for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature exhausted by this power can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the power ends.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.\r\n\r\n#### Itemize\r\n_At-will tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 30 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nYou instantly learn the exact quantity of one type of item within 30 feet of you. It must be a type of item that you've handled in the past; you can't, for example, use *itemize* to find out how many *BKGs* are nearby if you've never handled such a weapon. The object being itemized must also be reasonably specific. You can learn how many meilooruns are nearby, for example, but not how much fruit.\r\n\r\n#### Jump\r\n_1st-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Touch\r\n- **Duration:** 1 minute\r\n\r\nYou touch a creature. The creature's jump distance is tripled until the power ends.\r\n\r\n#### Jump Jet\r\n_1st-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nYou boost yourself through the air with a brief surge of repulsor energy. You can rise a number of feet equal to 20 x your techcasting ability modifier. You can also move a number of feet horizontally during any part of the movement equal to 5 x your techcasting ability modifier. At the end of the turn on which you cast this power, you float gently to the ground if you are still aloft.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you can rise an additional 20 feet, and move horizontally by another 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.\r\n\r\n#### Jump Pad\r\n_2nd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 60 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nYou create a bouncy surface in a 5-foot square on a surface within range. When you cast the power, you can designate creatures that can safely use the jump pad. For the duration, whenever a creature you haven't chosen enters the affected area, it must make a Dexterity saving throw or be launched 10 feet upwards, and 5 feet horizontally in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.\r\n\r\nWhile a creature you have chosen (or a creature that has succeeded its Dexterity saving throw) is in the area, it can use its reaction to jump with the aid of the bouncy surface. The creature's jump distance for this jump is multiplied by 5.\r\n\r\n#### Lesser Mislead\r\n_2nd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** 1 round\r\n\r\nYou become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts until the end of your next turn, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a power.\r\n\r\nYou can use your action to move your illusory double up to your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is attacked or would take damage, the double dissipates.\r\n\r\n#### Mutate/Augment\r\n_3rd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Self\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\r\n\r\nYou alter your body with tech, temporarily gaining new properties which last for the duration. You can select three of the following properties. You cannot select a property more than once, unless that property says otherwise.\r\n- Your body becomes more flexible. You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against effects that would grapple or restrain you, and your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain or squeezing.\r\n- You grow one additional appendage. This appendage serves as an arm and a hand, though it can take the shape of a limb, tentacle, or similar appendage. You can select this property twice to grow a maximum number of two appendages. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).\r\n- You sprout antennae that give you tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.\r\n- You extend the length of your limbs. When you make a melee attack or attempt to grapple, shove, or trip a creature on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.\r\n- You gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed.\r\n- Your flesh hardens. Your AC can't be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor you're wearing.\r\n- You can gain the benefits of any one option of the _alter self_ power. You can select this property multiple times to gain the benefits of multiple options of the _alter self_ power, choosing a different option each time.\r\n- You gain the effect of the _magnetic hold_ power, but you can affix to and move along any surface, instead of only metallic surfaces. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.\r\n- You can gain any one effect of the _force enlightenment_ power.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, you can select an additional property for each slot level above 3rd.\r\n\r\n#### Production Values\r\n_At-will tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 30 feet\r\n- **Duration:** 1 minute\r\n\r\nYou cause a minor effect within range. Choose one of the following:\r\n- Your natural voice booms up to three times louder than normal for 1 minute. You can also alter the sound of your voice to achieve a certain effect--to sound more intimidating, for example.\r\n- You cause unenhanced electronic lights to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.\r\n- You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.\r\n- You create a sound within range for up to 1 minute. The sound can range in volume from a whisper to a scream.\r\n- You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.\r\n- You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.\r\n- You create an illusory image of an object no larger than a 5 foot cube. The illusion is purely visual.\r\n\r\nIf you cast this power multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\r\n\r\nA creature that witnesses the effects of this power can use its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. On a successful check, the creature discerns that the effects are illusory, and they become faint to the creature.\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of active effects increases by 3 when you reach 5th level (6), 11th level (9), and 17th level (12).\r\n\r\n#### Skill Protocol\r\n_5th-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Touch\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\r\n\r\nYou enhance a droid or construct's protocols. You touch one willing droid or construct and give it expertise in one tool or skill of your choice.\r\n\r\nYou must choose a tool or skill in which the target is proficient and that isn't already benefiting from an effect, such as expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Spectrum Discharge\r\n_2nd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action\r\n- **Range:** Touch\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nYou touch a willing creature, granting it an elemental charge. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison or sonic. For the duration, a creature can use an action to expel energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.\r\n\r\n#### Stinger\r\n_At-will tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 120 feet\r\n- **Duration:** 1 round\r\n\r\nYou fire a stinging dart at a creature within range. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 poison damage, and if the target is a humanoid or beast, it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nThis power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\r\n\r\n#### Squad Shield\r\n_7th-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take in response to an incoming threat\r\n- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nIn the face of danger, you create a barrier that protects you and those around you. A faintly glowing sphere of protection with a radius of 10 feet appears. The sphere lasts for the duration.\r\n\r\nAny tech power (or force power that deals energy or lightning damage) of 7th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the power is cast using a higher level tech slot. Such a power can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the power has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, hazards of the following types cannot physically pass through the barrier or affect anything within it.\r\n\r\n- Physical or energy projectiles.\r\n- A specific effect, such as a thermal detonator's explosion.\r\n- An environmental danger, such as falling rocks or a lava flow.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 8th level or higher, the maximum radius increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 7th. In addition, the barrier blocks powers of one level higher for each slot level above 7th.\r\n\r\n#### Time Bomb\r\n_1st-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Touch\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nMake a melee tech attack against a target you touch. On a miss, this power ends. On a hit, you deal 2d6 kinetic damage as you plant an explosive charge on the target's body. You can then detonate the charge as a bonus action, which ends this power. It deals 1d8 fire damage if detonated on the same turn. It deals 2d8 fire damage on your next turn, increasing by 1d8 for each round you do not detonate it, to a maximum of 6d8. If this power ends before you detonate the charge, the target takes no fire damage.\r\n\r\nA creature affected by this power can use an action to attempt to remove the detonator from its person, making a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature chooses the ability to use) against your tech save DC. On a success, this power ends, as the detonator deactivates harmlessly.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the kinetic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.\r\n\r\n#### Transposition\r\n_2nd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 90 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nAnother creature you can see within range has its form shimmer in a holographic configuration before collapsing. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (the target can choose to fail), or the target is teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the range of the power increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 2nd.\r\n\r\n#### Tri-Shot\r\n_At-will tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 60 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nChoose up to three creatures within range, none of whom can be more than 10 feet apart. If you choose three creatures, each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 energy damage. If you choose two creatures, each target takes 1d6 energy damage on a failed save instead. If you choose only one creature, the target takes 1d8 energy damage on a failed save.\r\n\r\nThis power's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (two dice), 11th level (three dice), and 17th level (four dice).\r\n\r\n#### Tune-up\r\n_2nd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes\r\n- **Range:** 30 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Instantaneous\r\n\r\nUp to six droids or constructs of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your techcasting ability modifier.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\r\n\r\n#### Warp Strike\r\n_At-will tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** Varies\r\n- **Duration:** 1 round\r\n\r\nAs part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack\u2019s normal effects, and you can teleport to an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of you. If you teleport to a space within 5 feet of the target, the target cannot take reactions until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\nThis power\u2019s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 energy damage to the target. This extra energy damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n#### Wire Tow\r\n_2nd-level tech power_\r\n___\r\n- **Casting Time:** 1 action\r\n- **Range:** 30 feet\r\n- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\r\n\r\nYou project a length of wire towards a foe to bring them within your grasp. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 kinetic damage, and you can pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. If you score a critical hit, the target is also knocked prone. If the target ends this movement within 5 feet of you and is no more than one size larger than you, the target is grappled by you for the duration.\r\n\r\nIf a creature you grapple with this power uses its action to escape, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your tech save DC to do so.\r\n\r\nThis power ends if the attack misses or the grapple ends.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.",

    "contentMarkdown": "# Variant Rules\r\n\r\n## Compound Checks\r\n\r\nOccasionally, as GM, you might put forth a task for your players that is more difficult than they might be prepared for, and that task might have multiple ways to accomplish it, such as asking your operative to make an ability check to conceal a device on a highly perceptive individual. This task could be reasonable accomplished with a (Dexterity) Sleight of Hand check or a Charisma (Deception) check. Rather than choosing between the two possible checks, the player could elect to do both. If they do so, they must make two separate ability checks, but the target DC for the checks should be reduced by 5.\r\n\r\nFor instance, using the above example, you might set the DC for the initial check to be 25, allowing the character to perform a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check or Charisma (Deception) check. The player might instead decide to attempt both checks. If they do so, they must instead succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check and a DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check. If they succeed on both checks, they accomplish their task. If the fail on either check, they fail the task regardless of the outcome of the other check.\r\n\r\n### Minimum DC\r\nFor even more difficult tasks with multiple possible solutions, characters can attempt even more ability checks. For each ability check beyond the first, the DC should decrease by 5, cumulatively, to a minimum DC of 20. For instance, a DC 30 check could instead be accomplished by two separate DC 25 ability checks or even three DC 20 ability checks, provided there are sufficient different ability checks that could apply.\r\n\r\n### Degrees of Failure\r\nYou might also consider implementing degrees of failure if a character attempts to perform compound checks and fails one or more of them. For instance, if a character attempts a compound check with two separate ability checks and fails on one or both, you might determine the outcome for failing both to be significantly worse than only failing one.\r\n\r\n## Strenuous Combat\r\n\r\nCombat is a stressful activity, both physically and mentally. If you want to add an additional layer to combat to help encourage your players to handle things in a more civilized manner, consider implementing this variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Concluding Combat\r\nAt the end of a combat encounter, you might consider having each surviving participant make a Constitution saving throw to avoid exhaustion. The DC for the saving throw is equal to 10 + the number of complete rounds that occurred during the encounter. On a failure, a creature suffers 1 level of exhaustion.\r\n\r\n### More Restful Rest\r\nExhaustion is a painful penalty to add to characters, especially if they end up encountering multiple levels of exhaustion over the course of a gaming day. When your players' characters complete a short rest with exhaustion from this variant, consider allowing them to spend a Hit Die at the end of that rest to remove one level of exhaustion. \r\n\r\nIf a character encounters multiple levels of exhaustion due to this variant, they can spend more Hit Dice to remove the additional levels, either during the same rest or separate ones. Each time they do so, however, the effect is cumulative for each additional level. Removing a second level of exhaustion would take two Hit Dice, while a third would take three, and so on. For instance, if a character completes a short rest with two levels of exhaustion from this variant, they could spend one Hit Die to remove one level of exhaustion, or three Hit Dice to remove both. Once a creature has completed a long rest, the number of Hit Dice to be spent to remove this exhaustion is reduced back to one.\r\n\r\n## Ammunition Sizes\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity, ammunition is shared amongst weapons that deal the same damage type. For instance, all blasters that deal kinetic damage utilize slug cartridges, while all blasters that deal energy, ion, or other elemental damage types utilize power cells. If you dislike that an assault cannon and a blaster pistol utilize the same ammunition, consider the following variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Damage Dice Ammo Size\r\nSlug cartridges and power cells are each broken down into five size categories, from Tiny to Huge. These new sized ammunitions only fit in weapons that utilize certain damage values, as shown in the below table.\r\n\r\n|Ammo Size|Damage Dice|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Tiny|d4|\r\n|Small|d6|\r\n|Medium|d8/2d4|\r\n|Large|d10\r\n|Huge|d12/2d6/3d4|\r\n\r\nFor those weapons with alternative damage types, you'll want to treat their damage as one step higher. Ion damage should be two steps higher or twice the weapon's damage, whichever is lower.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a blaster which deals 1d8 energy damage would use Medium power cells, while a blaster that deals 1d4 kinetic damage would use Tiny slug cartridges. A blaster that deals 1d4 fire damage, however, would use Small power cells (since we treat that damage as one step higher), as would a blaster that deals 1d3 ion damage (since we treat that damage as two steps higher).\r\n\r\n### Ammo Size Values and Weights\r\nAdditionally, the value and weight of these sized munitions would scale, as shown in the table below.\r\n\r\n|\tItem\t|\tCost\t|\tWeight\t\t|\r\n|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|\t_Ammunition_\t|\t\t|\t\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Power cell (Tiny)            \t    |\t  3 cr\t|\t1/4 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Power cell (Small)            \t|\t  5 cr\t|\t1/2 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Power cell (Medium)            \t|\t  10 cr\t|\t1 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Power cell (Large)            \t|\t  20 cr\t|\t2 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Power cell (Huge)                \t|\t  50 cr\t|\t5 lb\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Slug cartridge (Tiny)             |\t   1/2 cr\t|\t\ufffd\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Slug cartridge (Small)            |\t   1 cr\t|\t\ufffd\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Slug cartridge (Medium)           |\t   2 cr\t|\t\ufffd\t\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Slug cartridge (Large)            |\t   4 cr\t|\t1/4\tlb\t|\r\n|\t&emsp;Slug cartridge (Huge)             |\t   10 cr\t|\t1/2 lb\t\t|\r\n\r\n> #### Powered by Power Cells\r\n> Items that are powered by power cells, such as jetpacks or glowrods, would utilize Medium power cells.\r\n\r\n## Alternate Casting\r\n\r\nInspired by the Dimension 20 actual play campaign A Starstruck Odyssey, where one of the main characters is using sentinel bones but with techcasting instead of forcecasting, I've created the following variant rule. \r\n\r\n### Saving Throws\r\nFor the five classes with native casting (consular, engineer, guardian, scout, sentinel) you'll want to make the following adjustments to their saving throws.\r\n- **Consular:** Replace Charisma with Intelligence.\r\n- **Engineer:** Replace Intelligence with Charisma.\r\n- **Guardian:** Replace Charisma with Intelligence.\r\n- **Scout:** No changes.\r\n- **Sentinel:** Replace Charisma with Intelligence.\r\n\r\n### Force- and Tech-casting\r\nYou'll want to replace the Forcecasting feature with Techcasting, and vice versa, as appropriate. Specifically, **Force Powers Known**, **Force Points**, and **Forcecasting Ability** will want to be replaced with **Tech Powers Known**, **Tech Points**, and **Techcasting Ability**, and vice versa, as described below:\r\n\r\n> Note that Max Power Level is not mentioned because it is not affected by these changes.\r\n\r\n- **Consular:** Replace consular Forcecasting with engineer Techcasting.\r\n- **Engineer:** Replace engineer Techcasting with consular Forcecasting.\r\n- **Guardian:** Replace guardian Forcecasting with scout Techcasting.\r\n- **Scout:** Replace scout Techcasting with guardian Forcecasting. Mechanist scout should instead replace Improved Techcasting with sentinel Forcecasting.\r\n- **Sentinel:** Replace sentinel Forcecasting with the Improved Techcasting present in the Mechanist Technique scout archetype, with the following updates: sentinels will have 5 and 6 tech powers known, and 2 and 3 tech points, at 1st and 2nd levels, respectively.\r\n- **Splashcasters:** Replace Forcecasting with Techcasting, and vice versa, of the other splashcasting archetype for that class. For instance, Shield Specialist fighter would replace its Techcasting feature with Adept Specialist fighter's forcecasting.\r\n\r\n> For the crosscaster archetypes, such as Way of Technology consular, you can simply flip the powers accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Class Features\r\nDifferent classes or archetypes with casting as a core component are typically built around that casting's primary ability score. You'll want to update or replace them, as appropriate to the class or archetype, including capstones.\r\n\r\n### Short or Long Rest Recovery\r\nYou can also consider swapping the point recovery rest requirements, creating short rest force points or long rest tech points. To do so, you'll want to halve the base number of force points (not accounting for ability modifier) to account for short rest recovery, or double the base number of tech points (again not accounting for ability modifier) to account for long rest recovery. For instance, a consular with long rest forcecasting gets four tech points for each consular level (before modifier). If you wanted to do a short rest forcecasting consular instead, you'd only receive two tech points per consular level. The opposite would be true for an engineer; while they would get two tech points per engineer level as with short rest recovery techcasting, they would instead get four tech points per engineer level for long rest casting (again, ignoring additional tech points from their ability modifier).\r\n\r\nNote that if you are only swapping the rest mechanics, this has no impact on powers known or casting ability, as discussed earlier in this variant rule.\r\n\r\n> #### Sundry Sidney\r\n> For those of you watching A Starstruck Odyssey, Sundry Sidney is a sentinel using techcasting instead of forcecasting. While they swapped the powers known, type of points, and casting ability, they maintained the long rest recovery of points. Consequently, she kept the three points per level a sentinel would normally receive, instead of halving the number received as with Improved Techcasting present in the Mechanist Scout archetype.\r\n\r\n## Invocation Versatility\r\n\r\nWith the semi-recent release that added a second level of customization classes that lack them\ufffdcollectively referred to as invocations, due to their inspiration from the warlock feature of that name\ufffdevery class now has two levels of customization available to them: their class's invocation feature, and their archetype. Most (all?) of the class's invocation features are hard-locked; that is, once you choose it, you've got it for life. Benevolent GMs might allow players to replace a choice if they found it underwhelming, but others might not. With this variant rule, however, it is encouraged for GMs to allow their player's to rechoose invocations *on a case-by-case basis.*\r\n\r\n### What are Invocations?\r\nBeyond their choice of archetype, each class has a second level of customization collectively referred to as invocations. These invocations are as follows:\r\n- Berserkers have Berserker Instincts.\r\n- Consulars have Force-Empowered Casting.\r\n- Engineers have Modification Slots, which vary based on their class.\r\n- Fighters have their Combat Superiority Maneuvers.\r\n- Guardians have their Guardian Auras.\r\n- Monks have their Monastic Vows.\r\n- Operatives have their Operative Exploits.\r\n- Scholars have their Academic Superiority Maneuvers *and* Discoveries.\r\n- Scouts have their Scout Routines.\r\n- Sentinels have their Sentinel Ideals.\r\n\r\nOf the ten classes, only engineers (mostly), fighters, and scholars can re-choose their invocations, and even then only sparingly. Using this rule, you can instead let all ten classes re-choose their invocations, at appropriate intervals.\r\n\r\n### When Can They Re-choose?\r\nThe easiest route would be to allow characters to re-choose one of their invocation options when they complete a long rest, or even when they level up. Alternatively, you might enforce a narrative moment for them to re-choose. For instance, a guardian might not be able to relearn their Guardian Aura without spending some time with their master, while a monk might have to spend time in a monastery to re-choose a Monastic Vow, and a scout might have to spend time alone practicing to re-choose a Scout Routine. Ultimately, the method in which allow your players to re-choose their invocations is up to you and your playgroup. You might even let them re-choose on the fly.\r\n\r\n### Re-choosing Archetypes or Classes?\r\nRe-choosing archetypes or classes is not intended as a part of this variant rule. However, you could easily allow players to do so, though I'd recommend the narrative approach over the simple level up or long rest.\r\n\r\n## Elevation\r\n\r\nOne aspect of 5e that has been more-or-less untouched is the concept of using elevation to your advantage beyond just creatures not being able to reach you. This variant rule offers mechanical boons to encourage utilizing elevation as a tactical device. Elevation grants a bonus called dominance, which comes in three levels.\r\n\r\nA creature has **dominance** over another creature if it is at least 10 feet above that creature vertically, and at least 10 feet away from that creature horizontally. While a creature has dominance over another, it has a +2 bonus to ranged attack rolls against the dominated creature, and the dominated creature suffers a -2 penalty to Dexterity saving throws against effects the creature dominating it controls. Additionally, a creature with dominance has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against a creature it is dominating.\r\n\r\nA creature has **superdominance** over another creature if it is at least 20 feet above that creature vertically, and at least 20 feet away from that creature horizontally. While a creature has superdominance over another, it has a +3 bonus to ranged attack rolls against the superdominated creature, and the superdominated creature suffers a -3 penalty to Dexterity saving throws against effects the creature dominating it controls. Additionally, a creature with superdominance has a +3 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against a creature it is dominating.\r\n\r\nA creature has **hyperdominance** over another creature if it is at least 30 feet above that creature vertically, and at least 30 feet away from that creature horizontally. While a creature has hyperdominance over another, it has a +5 bonus to ranged attack rolls against the hyperdominated creature, and the hyperdominated creature suffers a -5 penalty to Dexterity saving throws against effects the creature dominating it controls. Additionally, a creature with hyperdominance has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against a creature it is dominating.\r\n\r\nA creature can only benefit from one level of dominance at a time for each creature it would be dominating, but it can have different levels of dominance for different creatures. For instance, if a creature is 30 feet above another creature both vertically and horizontally, it is hyperdominating that creature. If it is 20 feet above another creature vertically and 15 feet horizontally, it is only dominating the third creature instead of superdominating, since both values exceed 10 feet, but not 20.\r\n\r\n### Advantage and Disadvantage\r\nIf a creature has advantage, it can choose to forgo that advantage when making an attack to increase its domination level by one against its target until the end of its turn. For instance, if a creature has advantage and is 20 feet above another creature both vertically and horizontally, it is superdominating that creature. The creature can choose to forgo its advantage to instead hyperdominate the creature until the end of its turn.\r\n\r\nIf a creature is suffering from disadvantage, it can't dominate another creature regardless of how far away from that creature it is, horizontally or vertically.\r\n\r\n### Cover\r\nIf a creature would be dominating another creature, and it also has cover from that creature, the bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws don't stack. Instead, the dominating creature gains the higher of the two bonuses. For instance, if a creature is dominating another creature, and it also has half cover from that creature, it only gains the +3 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against that creature. However, if the dominated creature has a feature that allows it to ignore the benefit of cover, such as Sharpshooter Mastery, the dominating creature would still gain the +2 benefit from dominating the other creature.\r\n\r\nConversely, if a creature is both dominated by another creature, and it has cover from that creature, you don't add the bonus and penalty together. Instead, you reduce a creatures dominance by one for each level of cover it has. For instance, if a creature is superdominated by a creature, but it also has one-quarter cover from that creature, it is instead just dominated. If the creature that is dominating it has a feature that allows it to ignore the benefit of cover, such as a Sharpshooter Mastery, however, the creature is still superdominated since the creature dominating it isn't affected by the cover.\r\n\r\n## Gestalt and Dichotomous Characters\r\n\r\nBest suited for smaller parties, gestalt and dichotomous Characters are two separate variant rules that have some conceptual overlap. Gestalt focuses on a character having two classes simultaneously, while, dichotomous focuses on having one class, with two archetypes. If either\ufffdor Ashla forbid, both\ufffdof these concepts sound intriguing to you, consider the following variant rules.\r\n\r\n### Gestalt Characters\r\nAs indicated above, gestalt characters level in two classes simultaneously. They gain all of the proficiencies and features of each class, with following adjustments.\r\n\r\n#### Experience Gain\r\nBecause a character is leveling in two classes simultaneously, the amount of experience that character should require to gain a level should double. For instance, going from 2nd level to 3rd requires 600 experience points. For a gestalt character, it instead requires 1,200.\r\n\r\n#### Hit Points and Hit Dice\r\nIf a character chooses two classes with different sized Hit Dice, they should take the average of the two Hit Die sizes (rounded down), and they don't add the Hit Dice together. For instance, if a gestalt character chooses to level in consular, who has a d6 Hit Die, and guardian, who has a d10 Hit Die, that character would have a d8 Hit Die. If the player chooses consular and sentinel, who has a d8 Hit Die, however, their Hit Die would be a d6, since that would be the average of the two Hit Die sizes rounded down.\r\n\r\n#### Starting Proficiencies and Equipment\r\nFor starting proficiencies and equipment, what you receive varies:\r\n\r\n***Saving Throws.*** You choose the saving throw pair offered by either class. You cannot mix-and-match, and you do not get both.\r\n\r\n***Skills.*** You choose the skills offered by one of your classes. You cannot mix-and-match, and you do not get both.\r\n\r\n***Weapons, Armor, and Tools.*** You gain the weapons, armor, and tool proficiencies for both classes.\r\n\r\n***Starting Equipment.*** You gain the starting equipment\ufffdor starting wealth\ufffdfor either class. You cannot mix-and-match, and you do not get both.\r\n\r\n#### Ability Score Increases\r\nWhen a gestalt character reaches 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, they gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in both classes. At each of these levels, that character should only gain this feature once, instead of twice. Alternatively, you can give them the full +2 Ability Score Improvement from one class, and a feat from the other, as with the ASI and a Feat variant rule.\r\n\r\n#### Force- and Tech-Casting\r\nIf a character chooses two classes that both have force- or tech-casting, they use the following adjustments:\r\n- They determine their Max Power Level as if they were multiclassing. If the potential Max Power Level of the two classes combined would exceed 9, however, they instead use the fullcasting Max Power Level progression present on the Multiclass Max Power Level table.\r\n- They add the force or tech points from both classes together.\r\n- They learn their powers separately by class, as with multiclassing, and those powers are restricted by that class's native Max Power Level regardless of their gestalt Max Power Level.\r\n\r\nIf a character chooses two classes with opposing casting, they ignore these rules. For instance, if a gestalt character levels as consular and scout, force- and tech-casting are treated separately as determined by their class.\r\n\r\n#### Overlapping Features\r\nIf two classes receive features that overlap, and aren't otherwise mentioned, it's up to the GM to determine how those features interact.\r\n\r\n#### Multiclassing\r\nGestalt Characters are not suitable for multiclassing.\r\n\r\n### Dichotomous Characters\r\nInstead of your character leveling in two classes simultaneously, you can have your character level in one class, but with two archetypes from that class.\r\n\r\nWhen a character reaches third level, they gain an archetype of their choice for their chosen class. Using this variant, they instead can choose two. At each level within that class that they would gain archetype features, they gain the features for both archetypes. If archetypes offer features that conflict, it's up to the GM to determine how those features interact.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can have a dichotomous character choose the features of only one archetype at a given level, rather than both, allowing the player to mix and match archetype features.\r\n\r\n#### Multiclassing\r\nIf a dichotomous character multiclasses, and reaches third level in two or more classes, it's up to the GM to determine whether they gain multiple archetypes in each class, or only in one.\r\n\r\n### Gestalt and Dichotomous\r\nGestalt and dichotomous characters, since they impact only certain parts of the character generation experience, work seamlessly together. Simply follow the rules associated with gestalt characters, including the restriction on multiclassing, and allow them to choose two archetypes in each class at 3rd level.\r\n\r\n## Called Shots\r\n\r\nOften times, in combat, characters might want to target a specific body part or feature of their target when making an attack. This is commonly referred to as a \"called shot.\" If this is a mechanic you want to implement in your game, consider using the following variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Calling A Shot\r\nIn order to make a called shot, you must first be making an attack roll with advantage. If you want to turn that attack into a called shot, you can choose to do so by forgoing that advantage. If you do so, and the attack hits, the hit becomes a called shot.\r\n\r\n### Effects\r\nWhen you hit with a called shot, you can choose to deal normal weapon damage and then roll a d100 to determine the effect of the shot randomly using the Called Shot Effects table below. Alternatively, you can choose to roll your damage dice twice and take the lesser total. If you do so, you can choose the effect you want to cause on the Called Shot Effects table below, instead of determining it randomly.\r\n\r\n##### Called Shot Effects\r\n|d100|Effect|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|01-45|***Leg Shot.*** The creature gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn.|\r\n|46-90|***Arm Shot.*** The creature can not use an arm until the end of its next turn. If the creature has multiple arms, determine which arm is affected randomly.|\r\n|91-95|***Scatter Shot.*** If the creature attempts to cast a power before the end of its next turn, it must first make a concentration check (DC = 10 + the power's level). On a failure, any resources are spent and the power immediately fails.|\r\n|96-100|***Head Shot.*** The creature is blinded until the start of its next turn.|\r\n\r\n## Bonus Proficiencies\r\n\r\nUnlike traditional 5e, Star Wars 5e places a significantly greater emphasis on the use of tools. Additionally, Star Wars 5e has substantially more languages than traditional 5e, since it spans an entire galaxy, with hundreds if not thousands of species, each speaking their own language. Using this variant rule, you can add additional proficiencies in tools and languages to your players beyond those offered by their species, class, or background.\r\n\r\n### Proficiency Points\r\nEach character gains a number of proficiency points equal to their proficiency bonus. These proficiency points can be spent to learn languages or tool proficiencies at a ratio of 1 point per language or tool.\r\n\r\n#### Tool Expertise\r\nIf a character wants to instead use their points to gain expertise in a tool, the GM might allow them to spend 2 proficiency points to gain expertise in a tool in which they are already proficient.\r\n\r\n### When Are They Chosen?\r\nEach character can choose to spend their proficiency points at any time to gain proficiency in a language or tool. If they would do so in a moment when that language or proficiency would become relevant to the story, they must first justify how they already know that language or tool proficiency. For instance, if the party encounters a particular species from which they need to glean information, and they have no way to communicate with that species, one of your players might spend a proficiency point to learn the language that species speaks. In order to do so, however, they must first explain how they would know that language. Perhaps they grew up with a wandering member of that species who taught it to them? Or maybe they took this specific language as an elective during their education?\r\n\r\n### Alternative Proficiencies\r\nAlternatively, you might allow your players to spend their proficiency points to gain proficiency in weapons or armor. A character could spend 1 proficiency point to gain proficiency in a singular weapon, or 2 proficiency points to gain proficiency in a weapon category (all blasters, lightweapons, or vibroweapons). A character could also spend 2 proficiency points to gain proficiency in a type of armor. However, they would first need to have proficiency in the lesser armors. For instance, to gain proficiency in heavy armor, you must first have proficiency in medium armor. To gain proficiency in medium armor, you must first have proficiency in light armor.\r\n\r\n#### Skill Expertise\r\nIf a character wants to instead use their points to gain expertise in a skill, the GM might allow them to spend 4 proficiency points to gain expertise in a skill in which they are already proficient.\r\n\r\n## Alternative At-Wills and Extra Attack\r\n\r\nOne of my many gripes with 5e is that its cantrips scale with character level. I find that this doesn't make sense both mechanically and logically; if I multiclass 2 levels of fighter and 3 levels of warlock, I don't magically get Extra Attack, but for some reason I can create two beams when I cast *eldritch blast*. If you want to try alternative at-will power scaling, consider this variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Caster Level\r\nInstead of having at-will powers that improve at 5th, 11th, and 17th *character* level, instead have them scale at 5th, 11th, and 17th *caster* level. Caster level is, effectively, what you're calculating when you are determining your Max Power Level while multiclassing. \r\n\r\nTo determine your caster level, you divide your class's potential Max Power Level by 9, and then multiply the result by your number of levels in that class. That number is your caster level. For the full-caster classes\ufffdconsular and engineer\ufffdthis will be the same as your level in that class. For other casting classes and archetypes, your caster level will be lower than your level in that class.\r\n\r\nWhen multiclassing, you determine your caster level by dividing each class's potential Max Power Level by 9, multiplying the result by the number of levels in that class, adding the results for each class together, and rounding down the final result. For instance, if you have four levels in Marauder Approach berserker (1.77) and three levels in guardian (1.67), your caster level is 3.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nUltimately, the results of this variant rule mean that a 20th-level fighter who took the Force-Sensitive feat and the *shock* force power is no longer as potent with *shock* as a 20th-level consular. Both mechanically and flavorfully, this aligns to me. Additionally, it means the consular who focuses on the Force is also better with their at-will powers than an equal level guardian or sentinel, which again makes more sense mechanically and flavorfully. \r\n\r\n> ##### Favored At-Wills\r\n> Some archetypes, such as most sentinel archetypes or Soresu guardian, are built around a specific at-will. Your GM might consider letting characters of that archetype use native scaling. However, if adopting this variant rule, they should only scale with class level in this way, rather than character level.\r\n\r\n### Multiclassing Extra Attack\r\nIf using this variant rule, you might consider allowing characters who multiclass in classes with the Extra Attack feature to add their class levels together to gain that feature. Their combined level in those classes must satisfy the level requirement in both classes to receive this benefit, however. \r\n\r\nFor instance, a character with 2 levels in fighter and 3 levels in berserker would be eligible for Extra Attack, since their combined levels would meet the 5th-level requirement for Extra Attack in both classes. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a character with 2 levels in fighter and 3 levels in armormech engineer, would not be eligible for Extra Attack, since their combined levels levels don't meet the 6th-level requirement for Extra Attack in armormech engineer. If that character gains an additional level in either class, or a level in another class with the Extra Attack feature, however, they would now meet the requirements for Extra Attack in all three classes, and thus would gain the feature.\r\n\r\nIf a class or archetype has a restriction to their Extra Attack feature, such as armormech engineer requiring that you are wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain the benefit, the character must meet that requirement to gain the benefits of Extra Attack while multiclassing.\r\n\r\n#### Greater Extra Attack\r\nNo characters should receive the Greater Extra Attack feature through this multiclassing variant, since that feature is exclusive to fighter.\r\n\r\n## Longer Rests\r\n\r\nSW5e offers greater character customization than traditional 5e, and ultimately yields more powerful characters. If you find yourself struggling to challenge your party, consider using the following variant rule to make them stretch their resources.\r\n\r\n### Quick Rest\r\nA quick rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\r\n\r\nA character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a quick rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. Whenever a character spends a Hit Die to regain hit points, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.\r\n\r\n### Short Rest\r\nA short rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch, for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity\ufffdfighting, casting powers, at least 4 hours of walking, or similar adventuring activity\ufffdthe characters must restart the rest to benefit from it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a short rest, a character regains missing hit points up to half their hit point maximum (rounded up). A character can then spend one or more Hit Dice, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. Whenever a character spends a Hit Die to regain hit points, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.\r\n\r\nA character can't benefit from more than one short rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.\r\n\r\n### Long Rest\r\nA long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 2 days long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours each day, and performs light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch during the remainder of the long rest. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity\ufffdfighting, casting powers, at least 4 hours of walking, or similar adventuring activity\ufffdthe characters must restart the rest to benefit from it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one).\r\n\r\nA character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 7-day period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.\r\n\r\n### Power Durations and Other Effects\r\nCertain powers, such as *battle precognition* or *force barrier*, are powers that are intended to be cast once or twice per adventuring day. Since long rests are now once per week instead of once per day, consider increasing the duration of these powers to 24 hours, or even up to three days, as you deem appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Wounds\r\n\r\nWhen a character is reduced to 0 hit points, begins making death saving throws, and has hit points restored, they can return to the battle no worse for the wear. Using this variant rule, you can add an additional layer to make falling to 0 hit points more threatening.\r\n\r\n### Gaining Wounds\r\nWhen a character is reduced to 0 hit points, that character must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a success, nothing happens, but the DC of this saving throw for that character increases by 5, cumulatively, until they complete a short or long rest or fail the saving throw, at which point the DC resets to 10. On a failed save, the character suffers 1 wounded level. On a success or a failure, a creature immediately gains one death saving throw failure for each wounded level it has. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if a character with no wounded levels is reduced to 0 hit points and fails their Constitution saving throw, they gain 1 wounded level, and they then gain 1 death saving throw failure for their 1 wounded level. Alternatively, if a character with 2 wounded levels is reduced to 0 hit points and succeeds on their Constitution saving throw, they don't gain a wounded level, but they then gain 2 death saving throw failures for their 2 wounded levels. If they take damage, or fail the death saving throw they make at the start of their next turn, they immediately die.\r\n\r\n### Clearing Wounds\r\nA character loses all wounded levels when they are restored to their hit point maximum, whether through consumables, powers, resting, or other means.\r\n\r\n## Critical Saving Throws\r\n\r\nUnlike attack rolls, which have critical hits and critical misses, saving throws don't have critical successes or failures. Using this variant rule, you can allow critical successes and failures on saving throws.\r\n\r\n### Critical Success\r\nWhen a creature rolls a 20 on their saving throw against an effect, they automatically succeed on the saving throw, even if the result of their save would not meet or exceed the save DC. Additionally, if they would suffer any effects on a successful save, such as half damage, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the minimum.\r\n\r\n### Critical Failure\r\nWhen a creature rolls a 1 on their saving throw against an effect, they automatically fail the saving throw, even if the result of their save would meet or exceed the save DC. Additionally, if the effect would deal damage, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.\r\n\r\n### Features That Grant Critical Saves\r\nCertain features, such as the Explosives fighting style or the Heavy Weapon Specialization feat, grant the ability for certain saving throws to deal critical damage. If you are using this variant rule, instead have them expand the critical hit range by 1. For instance, while using this variant rule, a character with the Explosives fighting style would have a critical hit range of 2 on their grenades. Consequently, creatures that roll a 1 or a 2 on the saving throw against their grenades would critically fail their saves.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can consider allowing weapons with the keen property to increase the critical hit range of their burst or rapid properties.\r\n\r\n### Saving Throw Checks\r\nIf you use the Saving Throw Checks variant, you would instead allow effects to critically succeed if they would critically hit, and critically fail if they would critically miss, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Careful Checks\r\n\r\nWhen you spend at least 10 minutes performing an activity that requires an ability check, that check has consequences for failure, and you don't have disadvantage on the check, you can choose to make that check carefully, colloquially called \"taking 10\". If you do so, you treat the check as if you had rolled a 10 on the d20. For instance, if you are crafting an item, during resolution you make an Intelligence check with the appropriate tools to determine your d100 Roll Modifier. Instead of rolling the d20, you can make a careful check and take 10, treating the check as if you'd rolled a 10, adding your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus, if you are proficient with the tools.\r\n\r\nIf you would have advantage on the check, you can instead take 15. \r\n\r\n## Replacing Powers\r\n\r\nOften a player might feel restricted because they made a bad power choice, and they don't want to wait until their next level up to do so. If this is a mechanic that suits your players, consider using the following variant rule.\r\n\r\nEach time a character completes a long rest, they can attempt to take one power they know and replace it with another power, as long as that power is not of a higher level than their Max Power Level. If the character knows both force and tech powers, those powers can only be replaced with another force or tech power, respectively. \r\n\r\nThe character immediately unlearns the power they are trying to replace, and then must make a force- or tech-casting ability check (using Wisdom or Charisma as appropriate, depending on force power alignment) with proficiency. The DC of the check varies depending on the level of the power the character is attempting to learn, as shown in the Power Level Check DC table below.\r\n\r\n##### Power Level Check DC\r\n\r\n|Power Level|Check DC|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|0|10|\r\n|1|14|\r\n|2|16|\r\n|3|18|\r\n|4|20|\r\n\r\n|Power Level|Check DC|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|5|22|\r\n|6|24|\r\n|7|26|\r\n|8|28|\r\n|9|30|\r\n\r\nOn a success, the new power is learned. On a failure, the new power is not learned, the old power is still forgotten, and the character can't try again until their next long rest.\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to replace a power, if the character currently has a vacant power known slot, they do not need to first unlearn a power before attempting to fill that slot.\r\n\r\n## Exertion\r\n\r\nWhen the outlook of a situation is grim, player's might want to have their character attempt to go above and beyond, fueling their endeavors with their own vitality at the expense of potentially overexerting themselves through use of this variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Exert\r\nOnce per round, a player can have their character attempt to exert themselves. When the character makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, the character can roll a Hit Die without expending it, adding the result of the die to the roll. Alternatively, on their turn, the character can roll a Hit Die without expending it, increasing their speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of their turn. If the character has Hit Dice of different sizes, they can choose which Hit Die they use.\r\n\r\nThe character can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to exert themselves, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.\r\n\r\n### Over-Exertion\r\nWhen a character exerts themselves, they immediately lose hit points equal to the amount rolled, which can't be reduced or negated in any way. If this damage would reduce the character to 0 hit points, they don't immediately fall unconscious. At the end of the current turn, if the character is still at 0 hit points, they fall unconscious and are stable.\r\n\r\n## Simplified Styles and Masteries\r\n\r\nIn lieu of the fighting style and fighting mastery options available in the PHB, using this variant rule you can instead use the options present here.\r\n\r\n### Fighting Styles\r\nCertain class features or feats offer your choice of Fighting Style. Choose from the following. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\r\n\r\n#### Brawling\r\nYou are skilled at using your weight to your advantage.

Choose from the following. You can't take a Fighting Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\r\n\r\n#### Brawling Mastery\r\nYou've mastered using your weight to your advantage, easily wrangling targets around. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Your improvised weapons use a d6 for damage and gain the versatile (2d4) property.\r\n- Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).\r\n- Your speed isn't halved by carrying a grappled creature who is the same size category as you or smaller. \r\n- Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or an improvised weapon, you can make an additional unarmed strike or improvised weapon attack against the same target without the aid of your proficiency bonus (no action required).\r\n\r\n#### Close Quarters Shooting Mastery\r\nYou've mastered getting up close and personal with blaster weapons, maintain both rate of fire and accuracy.

You can only make this attack once per turn. If the two-handed attack was made with disadvantage or without your proficiency bonus, this attack is made the same way.\r\n- If you miss an attack while wielding a weapon in one hand, you can immediately attempt to shove that creature up to 5 feet directly away from you. You can only make this attempt once per turn. If the one-handed attack was made with disadvantage or without your proficiency bonus, this ability check is made the same way.\r\n\r\n## Tactical Initiative\r\n\r\nRather than each player character and creature acting on their own, two or more allied creatures can instead choose to act tactically and work together using this initiative variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Rolling Tactical Initiative\r\nWhen combat begins and initiative would be rolled, two or more allied creatures can choose to work as a unit, provided they can see or hear and understand each other. When they do so, they each roll initiative separately, adding any modifiers as appropriate. Once each individual party has rolled their initiative, the group then acts using the lowest result. Once a tactical group is formed, each character's initiative is set to the lowest result, even if the tactical group separates.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if three players want to use tactical initiative, and they roll a 17, an 11, and a 14, all three players will instead act on initiative 11.\r\n\r\n#### Multiple Tactical Groups\r\nThe party can use multiple tactical groups rather than all working in concert. For instance, a party of five might split into a tactical group of three and a tactical group of two, each group rolling their tactical initiative separately. A character can only belong to one tactical group at a time.\r\n\r\n### Acting in Concert\r\nWhen a tactical group's turn comes up in the initiative order, each member of the group acts together. Their turns and actions can come in any order, though each individual tactical group member is still limited to what actions they could normally take. Additionally, actions that could normally be broken up, such as when a fighter takes the Attack action and has the Extra Attack feature, can be broken up during the turn.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a 5th-level fighter might take the Attack action and make their first attack. Before they make their second attack, however, the operative ally in their tactical group might then take the Help action to grant them advantage before the fighter makes the second attack.\r\n\r\n### Separating a Tactical Group\r\nWhen a tactical group loses contact with each other, or if the tactical group chooses to break up on their turn (no action required), the tactical group becomes separated. When separated, each member of the former tactical group acts on their own, though they retain the initiative of the tactical group. The order of any active members of the former tactical group acting on the same initiative is determined randomly.\r\n\r\n## Alternative Armor\r\n\r\nTraditionally, armor class is designed entirely for avoidance. While unarmored or lightly armored, that's dodging the attack entirely. In medium or heavy armor, however, that's absorbing the attack on your armor in such a way that it deals no damage. If you want a different approach to armor, try this variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Armor Class (AC)\r\nBase armor class (AC), without consideration of any special traits, class features, or armor and shields, is always calculated as 10 + Dexterity modifier, with armor replacing or augmenting that base AC calculation. Using this system, your base armor class is instead calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Base AC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Damage Reduction (DR)\r\nDamage reduction (DR) is a static value that you subtract when you take damage if certain conditions are met. Certain features, such as the Defense fighting mastery or the absorptive armor property, grant DR that only applies when you take damage from weapons. DR is expressed as a number. DR provided by armor only affects damage you take as a result of being hit by an attack roll, in the same way that AC only helps you avoid being hit by an attack roll.\r\n\r\nIf passive DR would reduce the damage you take to 0, you instead take 1 damage.\r\n\r\n### Armor Class vs. Damage Reduction\r\nInstead of focusing solely on damage avoidance, this variant rule balances armor class and damage reduction, to better emphasize how armor is used. Each type of armor affects your AC and DR differently, as shown below.\r\n\r\n#### Light Armor\r\nAs normal, light armor does not prohibit the maximum Dexterity bonus you can receive to your AC. However, if the light armor had a higher base AC, extra AC instead becomes damage reduction (DR).\r\n\r\nFor instance, fiber armor normally increases your AC to 12 + Dexterity modifier. If you have a Dexterity modifier of +3, while wearing fiber armor you would have an AC of 15. With this variant rule, however, fiber armor instead grants you DR of 2 while allowing you to add your Dexterity modifier to your AC. If you have a proficiency bonus of +2, you would have an AC of 13 (8 + your proficiency bonus of +2 and your Dexterity modifier of +3) and DR of 2. \r\n\r\n#### Medium Armor\r\nMedium armor strikes a balance between AC and DR. As normal, it still allows you to add up to +2 to your AC if your Dexterity modifier is +2 or higher.\r\n\r\nFor instance, weave armor normally increases your AC to 14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2). If you have a Dexterity modifier of +2 or higher, while wearing weave armor you would have an AC of 16. With this variant \r\n\r\nrule, however, weave armor instead grants you DR of 4 while allowing you to add your Dexterity modifier (max 2) to your AC. If you have a proficiency bonus of +2, you would have an AC of 12 (8 + your proficiency bonus of +2 and your Dexterity modifier of +2) and DR of 4. \r\n\r\n#### Heavy Armor\r\nHeavy armor focuses entirely on DR. You gain no benefit to AC from your Dexterity modifier, but you also aren't penalized if your Dexterity modifier is negative.\r\n\r\nFor instance, assault armor normally increases your AC to 17. With this variant rule, however, assault armor instead grants you DR of 7, but it grants no benefit to your AC. If you have a proficiency bonus of +2, you would have an AC of 10 (8 + your proficiency bonus of +2) and DR of 7. \r\n\r\n#### Unarmored Defense and Natural Armor\r\nCertain species (such as wookie or colicoid), classes (such as monk or berserker), or archetypes (such as Blademaster Specialist fighter) grant unarmored defense or natural armor. When using this variant, the following rules apply.\r\n\r\n***Unarmored Defense.*** If your unarmored defense includes Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, you add that modifier to your AC as normal. If your unarmored defense includes your Constitution modifier, however, you instead treat that modifier as DR. For instance, a monk with a proficiency bonus of +2, a Dex modifier of +4, and a Wisdom modifier of +3 would have an AC of 17. A berserker with a proficiency bonus of +2, a Dex modifier of +4, and a Constitution modifier of +3, however, would have an AC of 14 and DR of 3. \r\n\r\n***Natural Armor.*** If your natural armor includes an adjustment to your base AC, that adjustment instead becomes DR. If your natural armor allows you to add your Dexterity modifier to your AC, you still add it as normal. For instance, a wookiee's hide grants them a base AC of 13 + Dexterity modifier. If the wookiee has a proficiency bonus of +2 and a Dexterity modifier of +2, instead of having an AC of 15 they would have an AC of 12 and DR of 3. A colicoid, however, who would have an AC of 17, with a proficiency bonus of +2, would have an AC of 10 and a DR of 7.\r\n\r\n#### Shields\r\nAs normal, shields add their bonus to AC.\r\n\r\n#### Enhanced Items\r\nIf an enhanced armor would add an additional bonus to AC, it instead increases DR. If an enhanced shield would add an additional bonus to AC, it continues to do so. If that bonus only applies to melee or ranged AC, it still only applies to melee or ranged AC or DR, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### Other AC Calculations\r\nWork with your GM to determine how other AC calculations, such as the *battle precognition* power or Way of Endurance consular's Upheld by the Force feature, should translate using these rules.\r\n\r\n## Aging\r\n\r\nSometimes, campaigns might take place over years, or even decades. As these campaigns progress, you might want to introduce mechanics to reflect your characters' natural aging. Alternatively, at character creation, you might want to create a character who is already at a later stage in life. Regardless of when your characters have aged, consider using the following variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Aging Thresholds\r\nEvery species ages at a different rate. While many near-human species age at the same rate as humans, reaching adulthood in their late teens, middle age in their 40's, elderly in their late 50's to early 60's, and venerability in their 70's, other species age differently. For instance, lanniks reach adulthood in their 50's and can live up to 900 years, while hutts aren't considered adults until they reach 200 years old and can live to be over a thousand.\r\n\r\nConsequently, rather than tying aging to numbers, we instead establish three thresholds: Middle-Age, Elderly, and Venerable. Each time a character reaches one of these thresholds, they gain one or more aging quirks and one or more aging boons, determined by the threshold they've reached. When they do so, the GM can determine choose which quirk and boon they get, or determine it randomly, using the Aging Quirks and Aging Boons tables below:\r\n\r\n##### Aging Quirks\r\n\r\n|d4|Quirk|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Your Strength score decreases by 1. Your maximum for this score decreases by 1.|\r\n|2|Your Dexterity score decreases by 1. Your maximum for this score decreases by 1.|\r\n|3|Your Constitution score decreases by 1. Your maximum for this score decreases by 1.|\r\n|4|Your base walking speed decreases by 5 feet.|\r\n\r\n##### Aging Boons\r\n\r\n|d4|Boon|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Your maximum for this score increases by 1.|\r\n|2|Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Your maximum for this score increases by 1.|\r\n|3|Your Charisma score increases by 1. Your maximum for this score increases by 1.|\r\n|4|You gain proficiency in a language, skill, tool, or weapon of your choice.|\r\n\r\nThese effects are cumulative. When a middle-aged character, who has one quirk and one boon, becomes elderly, they gain two more quirks and two more boons, for a total of three of each. Additionally, duplicates are only rerolled at separate thresholds. If, at middle-age, your Strength score decreased by 1, your Strength score could again decrease by 1 at elderly.\r\n\r\n#### Middle-Aged\r\nMost species enter middle age about halfway through their expected life. For humans and near-humans, this is typically in their 40's, while lanniks don't reach middle age until about 400 years, and hutts at about 600 years. When a character reaches middle age, the GM should choose one quirk and one boon. Alternatively, they can determine the quirk and boon randomly. \r\n\r\n#### Elderly\r\nLike middle age, at which age a species becoming elderly also varies. For humans and near-humans, this is typically in their late 50's to early 60's, while lanniks are considered elderly at about 600, and hutts at about 750 years. When a character becomes elderly, the GM should choose two quirks and two boons. Alternatively, they can determine the quirks and boons randomly, rerolling any duplicates.\r\n\r\n#### Venerable\r\nVenerable members of a species are rare and typically revered by the younger members of their species. Humans and near-humans become\r\nin their 70's, lanniks at about 750, and hutts over the age of 900. When a character becomes venerable, the GM should choose three quirks and three boons. Alternatively, they can determine the quirks and boons randomly, rerolling any duplicates.\r\n\r\n> #### Additional Aging Traits\r\n> Some species gain additional traits as they age. For instance, hutts have the unique special characteristic in that they never stop growing from birth to death. The GM can add quirks and boons as appropriate for members of those species. \r\n\r\n## Force-Bond\r\n\r\nWhen two Force-sensitive individuals spend time together, they can develop a powerful connection through the Force. While bonded in such a fashion, the two individuals gain a series of boons, depending on the strength of their bond. However, if the bond is unwilling, the individuals risk corruption by the dark side of the Force.\r\n\r\n### Developing a Bond\r\nWhen one creature wants to develop a bond with another, they must spend 1 hour meditating, which can be done during a short rest,  while within 30 feet of a target that they can see. At the end of this meditation, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is equal to the initiator's universal force save DC, and the target of this feature can choose to fail this save. On a failure, the two creature's develop a Force-bond.\r\n\r\n#### Valid Targets\r\nOnly sentient creatures who can cast force powers of 1st-level or higher can develop a Force-bond, and a creature can only be bonded in such a way to one other creature a time.\r\n\r\n### Strengthening a Bond\r\nIn order to strengthen their bond, bond-mates must remain with a certain distance of each other, as shown below in the Bond Distance and DC by Tier table. They must spend one week times the tier they are trying to achieve. For instance, to progress from 1st to 2nd tier takes two weeks, while progressing from 2nd to 3rd takes an additional three weeks. This time does not have to be continuous; bond-mates can spend three days together, two days apart, and then four more days together to achieve 2nd tier.\r\n\r\n##### Bond Distance and DC by Tier\r\n\r\n|&emsp;Tier|DC|Bond Distance|\r\n|:--:|:--:|--:|\r\n|&emsp;1st|13|10 feet&emsp;|\r\n|&emsp;2nd|14|30 feet&emsp;|\r\n|&emsp;3rd|15|300 feet&emsp;|\r\n|&emsp;4th|16|1 mile&emsp;|\r\n|&emsp;5th|17|10 miles&emsp;|\r\n\r\n|&emsp;Tier|DC|Bond Distance|\r\n|:--:|:--:|--:|\r\n|&emsp;6th|19|100 miles&emsp;|\r\n|&emsp;7th|20|1,000 miles&emsp;|\r\n|&emsp;8th|21|10,000 miles&emsp;|\r\n|&emsp;9th|22|100,000 miles&emsp;|\r\n|&emsp;10th|23|Limitless&emsp;|\r\n\r\n### Bond Features\r\nAt each tier, bond-mates unlock a certain feature. In order to benefit from these features, bond-mates must be within 10 feet of eachother. This distance changes as their bond strengthens, as shown above in the Bond Distance and DC by Tier table.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at 1st tier, the bond-mates must be within 10 feet of each other to benefit from their bond's features. At 2nd tier, however, they must only be within 30 feet of each other.\r\n\r\n#### 1st Tier\r\nBoth bond-mates always know precisely where their bond-mate is in relation to them, regardless of whether or not they can see or hear them.\r\n\r\n#### 2nd Tier\r\nBoth bond-mates can speak with each other as if they were standing within 5 feet, provided they share a language. At 6th tier, this communication becomes telepathic.\r\n\r\n#### 3rd Tier \r\nBoth bond-mates are constantly under the effects of the *sense emotions* force power, but they are only able &emsp;to read each other's emotions. This does not require &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;concentration for either bond-mate, and this &emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;feature can not be interrupted while both &emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;bond-mates are conscious.\r\n\r\n#### 4th Tier\r\nAs an action on each of their turns, bond-mates can pass items to each other. When a bond-mate uses their action in such a way, the other bond-mate must use their reaction to take the item.\r\n\r\n#### 5th Tier\r\nWhenever a bond-mate makes an ability check or attack roll with advantage due to the other bond-mate taking the Help action, they can reroll one of the dice once.\r\n\r\n#### 6th Tier\r\nWhen a bond-mate casts a force power, they can cast it as if they are standing within 5 feet of their bond-mate. If the power requires a target, and that target is not their bond-mate, they must be aware of the target's presence and location in order to target them with this power.\r\n\r\n#### 7th Tier\r\nWhen a bond-mate casts a power of 1st-level or higher that targets only themself, they can also target their bond-mate. \r\n\r\n#### 8th Tier\r\nWhenever a bond-mate is reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, the other bond-mate can use their reaction to cause them to drop to 1 hit point instead. \r\n\r\nOnce this feature has been used, neither bond-mate can use it again until they both complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### 9th Tier\r\nOn their turn, one bond-mate can use their action to give their bond-mate an additional turn. If they do so, the targeted bond-mate immediately takes an additional turn after the current bond-mate's turn. \r\n\r\nOnce this feature has been used, neither bond-mate can use it again until they both complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### 10th Tier\r\nWhenever a bond-mate takes damage, the other bond-mate can use their reaction to grant them resistance to the damage. If they do so, both bond-mates take the same amount of damage. Alternatively, when a bond-mate has hit points restored, they can use their reaction to halve the amount of hit points. If they do so, the other bond-mate regains the same number of hit points. These features can be used a number of times equal to the bond-mate's combined Wisdom or Charisma modifiers (their choice, a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when both bond-mates complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Breaking a Bond\r\nSometimes, creatures might want to end their Force-bond, whether the bond was created unbeknownst to them or they no longer wish to share the bond. To do so, one of the creatures must spend 10 minutes meditating on the bond, and then make a Charisma saving throw. The DC of this saving throw varies, depending on the tier of the bond, as shown above in the Bond Distance and DC by Tier table. On a success, the bond's tier is reduced by 1. If the bond's tier is 1, it is broken. On a failure, the bond's tier is not reduced, and you can't try again for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n## Crueler Criticals\r\n\r\nNormally, when you score a critical hit, you roll the damage dice twice and add your modifier once. For instance, if you are wielding a weapon that deals 1d8 kinetic damage and is governed by Strength, on a critical hit you deal 2d8 + your Strength modifier kinetic damage. Sometimes, poor rolls lead to you doing *less* damage on a critical hit than a normal hit. For instance, you might roll two 1's on your 2d8, which with your +3 Strength modifier is only 5 damage. This feels lackluster.\r\n\r\nWith this rule, instead of rolling the damage dice twice, you instead maximize the damage once and then roll the second die. So, using the above example, instead of rolling 2d8 and adding your Strength modifier, you instead roll 1d8, add 8 for the maximum die roll, and then add your Strength modifier. This will make critical hits feel more impactful.\r\n\r\n## Combination Weapons\r\n\r\nSome weapons\ufffdspecifically lightweapons\ufffdcan be used in a variety of ways. For instance, the iconic scenes with Darth Maul using his doublesaber, but with only one blade extended. Or more recently with Cal Kestis in Jedi: Fallen Order, where you could adjust from doublesaber fighting to single saber fighting, or vice versa, on the fly. If you want the option to combine weapons in this fashion, consider the following variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Weapon Combination\r\nCombining weapons requires three key components: the two weapons you want to combine, and the appropriate tools. Two weapons can only be combined by someone proficient with appropriate tools, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table in Wretched Hives.\r\n\r\n#### Valid Targets\r\nOnly unenhanced weapons of the same type can be combined, and you can't combine weapons that already have multiple modes, such as the IWS or bo-rifle. For instance, a lightweapon can only be combined with another lightweapon, while a vibroweapon can only be combined with another vibroweapon.\r\n\r\n#### Combining Weapons\r\nYou can only combine a number of weapons up to your proficiency bonus. Combining weapons takes one hour and requires an ability check with the appropriate tools, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table in Wretched Hives. The DC for the check is determined by the number of weapons being combined, as shown below in the Combination/Separation DC by Weapons table.\r\n\r\n##### Combination/Separation DC by Weapons\r\n|Weapons|Combination/Separation DC|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|2|10|\r\n|3|15|\r\n|4|20|\r\n|5|25|\r\n|6|30|\r\n\r\nOn a success, the weapons are correctly combined. On a failure, the weapons are not combined, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again.\r\n\r\n#### Separating Weapons\r\nSeparating weapons requires an ability check with the appropriate tool, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table. The DC for the check is determined by the total number of combined weapons before separating, as shown above in the Combination/Separation DC by Weapons table.\r\n\r\nOn a success, the weapons are correctly separated. On a failure, the weapons are not separated, you must wait 24 hours before you can try again, and you must roll a d20. If you roll a 1 on the d20, one currently combined weapon is destroyed. The GM should determine which weapon is destroyed randomly.\r\n\r\n### Combined Weapons\r\nOnce you've combined two weapons, you can readily switch between each weapon by using your object interaction on your turn. The combined weapon's weight is equal to the total weight of each individual part, and each weapon uses the appropriate damage and properties as shown in its statistics in the Weapons table.\r\n \r\nFor instance, a 3rd-level character decides they want to combine a greatsaber and a doublesaber. They have both weapons available, as well as a set of artificer's tools. After spending one hour, they make an ability check with the tools, resulting in a 17. The weapons are successfully combined, and using their object interaction each turn, the character can switch from a greatsaber to a doublesaber, or back again.\r\n\r\nWhen the character reaches 5th level, they decide they want to add a lightwhip to the mix. They obtain a lightwhip, and attempt to combine it with their current weapon over the course of an hour with their artificer's tools. At the end of the hour, however, they only roll an 8 on the check, failing to combine the third weapon. They must wait until tomorrow to try again.\r\n\r\n#### Blasters\r\nUnlike light- and vibro-weapons, you can't combine multiple blasters. Instead, you can integrate a wrist launcher attachment to a blaster, as long as the weapon lacks the fixed property. This attachment can fire all wrist launcher ammunition with a range of 20/40, or it can fire grenades with a range of 40/80. This attachment has a reload value of 2, it can have different ammunition types loaded simultaneously, and you can choose which ammunition you're using as you fire it (no action required). Each ammunition must be reloaded separately.\r\n\r\nWhen you would attempt to combine an additional weapon, you can instead attempt to increase this attachment's reload property by making an ability check with the appropriate tool and consulting the Combination/Separation DC by Weapons table.\r\n\r\n## Dueling\r\n\r\nDueling, be it with lightsabers or blasters, is an iconic experience in the Star Wars narrative. When you want to engage in a more narrative form of dueling, rather than traditional combat, consider the following rules.\r\n\r\n### Opponents\r\nMost often, dueling is an event suited only to two people. It might be a fight to the death, a fight for honor, or simply a fight to see who is better. Alternatively, it might simply be a sparring session. These rules are intended to potentially encompass all of these possibilities, but only for a traditional one versus one encounter.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\nThere are three major actions a dueling character can take: Attack, Defend, or Feint. During each round of dueling, each involved party must decide which of these three actions they will take.\r\n\r\n#### Attack\r\nThe most common action, a character can choose to attack. When a character chooses to attack, they have advantage on the attack roll during resolution if the opponent takes the Feint action, and disadvantage on the roll if the character takes the Defend action.\r\n\r\n#### Defend\r\nThe second action a character can take is is to defend. When a character chooses to defend, they have advantage on the attack roll during resolution if the opponent takes the Attack action, and disadvantage on the roll if the character takes the Feint action.\r\n\r\n#### Feint\r\nThe third action a character can take is to feint. When a character chooses to feint, they have advantage on the attack roll during resolution if the opponent takes the Defend action, and disadvantage if the character takes the Attack action.\r\n\r\n> #### Extra Attack\r\n> If one party has the Extra Attack feature, and the other party doesn't, consider allowing them to roll with an additional instance of advantage.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nOnce each party has chosen their action, they should each make an attack roll, with advantage or disadvantage as appropriate. The winner of the contest strikes a blow or scores a point, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### Ties\r\nGenerally, ties should either award a point to both parties\ufffdor no points to either party\ufffdat the discretion of the GM.\r\n\r\n### Strikes\r\nHow many strikes a character can take varies based on the lethality of the contest. You might grant each party a potential three strikes if sparring, or you might give them each strikes equal to their Constitution modifier in a lethal contest, or even strikes equal to their proficiency bonus in a fight for honor. \r\n\r\n## Overlapping Features\r\n\r\nMany species have features that make them better in certain martial ways: special traits like natural armor, armor and weapon proficiencies, or unarmed strikes and natural weapons. Counterintuitively, when those species choose certain classes, those features become obsolete instead of enhancing their class choice.\r\n\r\nIf you players choose such a species/class combination, consider using this variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Armor Proficiencies\r\nMany species come with specific armor proficiencies suited to their species' culture, such as chiss or draethos, or natural unarmored defense, such as aing-tii or wookie. If a player chooses a species and class combination that would grant the same armor proficiencies, or a species with natural armor and a class with unarmored defense, consider instead granting them a bonus depending on the type of armor, as shown below:\r\n___\r\n- **Unarmored Defense:** +1 bonus to AC while not wearing armor or wielding a shield.\r\n- **Light Armor:** +1 bonus to Dexterity saving throws while wearing light armor.\r\n- **Medium Armor:** +1 bonus to Constitution saving throws while wearing medium armor.\r\n- **Heavy Armor:** -1 damage taken from weapons while wearing heavy armor. If this would reduce the damage to 0, the damage is instead reduced to 1.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at 1st level, a draethos operative with a 16 in Dexterity would have +6 to Dexterity saving throws instead of +5 while wearing light armor, while a wookiee berserker with a 14 in Dexterity and a 16 in Constitution would have an Armor Class of 16 while unarmored, instead of 15. A character should only gain each bonus once.\r\n\r\n### Weapon Proficiencies\r\nMany species come with specific weapon proficiencies suited to their species' culture, such as chiss or tuskens. If a player chooses a species and class combination that would grant the same weapon proficiencies, consider instead granting them a +1 bonus to damage rolls with the chosen weapon. For instance, at 1st level, a chiss scout with a 16 in Dexterity would have a +4 to damage rolls instead of a +3 when attacking with a blaster pistol or sniper rifle. A character should only gain this bonus once, and this bonus does not apply if the species offers a choice of weapons, such as human or echani.\r\n\r\n### Unarmed Strikes/Natural Weapons\r\nMany species come with higher unarmed strike damage, such as twi'lek or zabrak, or a natural weapon, such as chevin or karkarodons, representing their natural aptitude with unarmed combat. If a player chooses a species, class, or customization option combination that would both grant an increased unarmed strike, consider instead granting them a +1 bonus to their unarmed strike damage. For instance, at 1st level, a zabrak monk with a 16 in Dexterity would do 1d4+4 instead of 1d4+3 with their unarmed strikes. A character should only gain this bonus once.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, consider allowing those species that have natural weapons to use those weapons in place of their unarmed strikes, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Situational Expertise\r\nCertain special traits, such as the aqualish Arms Dealer trait, give expertise in a skill in a certain situation. If you would already have expertise in that situation, instead treat this feature as if it gave advantage.\r\n\r\n## Compound Advantage\r\nTypically, multiple instances of advantage or disadvantage don't stack; you either have it or you don't, and if you have both, you essentially have neither. This variant rule is designed to allow sources of advantage\ufffdand disadvantage\ufffdto stack, to a maximum of three times.\r\n\r\nWhen you have two sources of advantage, you instead have **superadvantage**, which allows you to roll two additional d20s when you make your ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, and take the highest of the three dice. If you have three sources of advantage, however, you instead have **hyperadvantage**, which allows you to roll three additionals d20s and take the highest of the four. Consequently, if you have two sources of disadvantage, you instead have **superdisadvantage**, and if you have three sources of disadvantage, you have **hyperdisadvantage**, rolling three and four d20s, respectively, and taking the lowest.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, advantage and disadvantage no longer completely cancel each other out. Instead, if you have two sources of advantage and one source of disadvantage, you instead have one source of advantage. For instance, if you are hidden from a creature, and an ally within 5 feet of it takes the Help action, you would have two sources of advantage\ufffdsuperadvantage\ufffdwhen you make your attack roll. If the creature is heavily obscured from you, however, you would have disadvantage on the attack roll, shifting you from superadvantage to advantage.\r\n\r\nEach source of advantage or disadvantage must be unique. For instance, if you are hidden from a creature, and an ally within 5 feet of it takes the Help action, you would have two sources of advantage\ufffdsuperadvantage\ufffdwhen you make your attack roll. If another ally also takes the Help action, however, you still only have two unique sources of advantage, thus granting only superadvantage.\r\n\r\n> Some customization options, such as the Supreme Accuracy feat, grant bonuses if you would have advantage. If you elect to use this variant rule, adjust these customization options to instead grant an additional source of advantage if you would already have advantage. For instance, if you have the Supreme Accuracy feat, if you have no source of advantage, you gain no benefit from the second bullet of the feat. If you have a source of advantage, however, the feat instead grants you superadvantage (or potentially hyperadvantage if you have an additional source of advantage).\r\n\r\n### Passive Checks\r\nWhen determining your total for a passive check with this variant rule, if you have superadvantage on a check, add 8. For superdisadvantage, subtract 8. If you have hyperadvantage on a check, add 10, and if you have hyperdisadvantage, subtract 10.\r\n\r\n### Careful Checks\r\nIf you would have superadvantage on a careful check, you can instead take 18. If you have hyperadvantage on a check, you can instead take 20.\r\n\r\n## Flanking\r\n\r\nWhen multiple creatures within 5 feet of another creature engage it in combat, that creature may become flanked. This variant rule offers mechanical boons to flanking separate from simple advantage.\r\n\r\nA creature who is **one-quarter flanked** suffers a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws against sources within 5 feet of it. A creature is one-quarter flanked if it is at least one-fourth surrounded, either to a side, above, or below.\r\n\r\nA creature who is **half flanked** suffers a -3 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws against sources within 5 feet of it. A creature is half flanked if it is at least half surrounded, either to a side, above, or below.\r\n\r\nA creature who is **three-quarters flanked** suffers a -5 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws against sources within 5 feet of it. A creature is three-quarters flanked if it is at least three-quarters surrounded, either to a side, above, or below.\r\n\r\n> Alternatively, you can have players add a +2, +3, or +5 bonus to their attack rolls against creatures who are one-quarter, half, or three-quarters flanked, respectively, by them. Additionally, if you use the Saving Throws Checks variant, you can instead have them add a +2, +3, or +5 bonus to their Dexterity saving throw checks against creatures who are one-quarter, half, or three-quarters flanked, respectively, by them.\r\n\r\nA creature who has a reach of greater than 5 feet gains the benefit of flanking against a creature while within melee range, but does not contribute towards flanking unless they are within 5 feet of the target.\r\n\r\n***Flanking on Squares.*** On a square grid, a Small or Medium creature takes up one square, and has eight squares surrounding it within 5 feet. When two or three of those squares are occupied by hostile creatures, that creature is considered one-quarter flanked by those creatures. When four or five of those squares are occupied by hostile creatures, that creature is considered half flanked by those creatures. If six or more of those squares are occupied by hostile creatures, that creature is instead considered three-quarters flanked.\r\n\r\n***Flanking on Hexes.*** On a hex grid, a Small or Medium creature takes up one hex, and has six hexes surrounding it within 5 feet. When two of those squares are occupied by hostile creatures, that creature is considered one-quarter flanked by those creatures. When three or four of those squares are occupied by hostile creatures, that creature is considered half flanked by those creatures. If five or six of those hexes are occupied by hostile creatures, that creature is instead considered three-quarters flanked.\r\n\r\n> Alternatively, you can run the simpler ruleset for flanking found in the DMG, that offers advantage instead of flat bonuses. That ruleset works alongside Advanced Advantage as well.\r\n\r\n### Standing from Prone while Flanked\r\nWhen a creature attempts to stand from prone while flanked, it can choose to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (DC = 10 + its penalty from flanking). On a success, the creature stands and can move to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it without provoking opportunity attacks. On a failure, the creature remains prone and loses the movement it would have used to stand.\r\n\r\n## Force Alignment\r\n\r\nThe Force is manifested by two powerful and opposing aspects: the Ashla and the Bogan, more commonly known as the light side and the dark. As force-wielding characters evolve throughout the game, they can gravitate towards one side or the other (or neither, should they choose), resulting in physical manifestations and boons.\r\n\r\n### Alignment Score\r\nHow much a character embodies an aspect of the Force is calculated using their Alignment Score. The Alignment Score is an ever-shifting value falling between Light 100 to Dark 100. Characters gain an Alignment Score by gaining Light/Dark Points, as determined by their actions.\r\n\r\n### Gaining Light/Dark Points\r\nWhen a character performs an act associated with one side of the Force, they gain points accordingly. Players can gain Light Points through a multitude of actions:\r\n- The first time you cast a light side force power of 1st-level or higher, you gain Light Points equal to the power's level. Subsequent castings of that power earn you 1 Light Point.\r\n- Committing selfless acts, such as deliberately saving others at the expense of yourself, can earn you 1 or more Light Points.\r\n- Other benevolent acts, as determined by your GM, can earn you 1 or more Light Points.\r\n\r\nConsequently, players can also gain Dark Points through various actions:\r\n- The first time you cast a dark side force power of 1st-level or higher you gain Dark Points equal to the power's level. Subsequent castings of that power earn you 1 Dark Point.\r\n- Committing truly heinous acts, such as harming or murdering an innocent, can earn you 1 or more Dark Points.\r\n- Other evil acts, as determined by your GM, can earn you 1 or more Dark Points.\r\n\r\nIf a character has a score and performs an opposing act, instead of gaining points towards the other aspect of the Force, they lose them from their current score. For instance, if a player has 5 Light Points, and casts a dark side power of 4th level, they would have their Light Points reduced to 1. If the player instead casts a dark side power of 7th level, their score would shift to Dark 2.\r\n\r\n### Alignment Tiers\r\nAs you earn Light/Dark Points, you reach certain tiers of Alignment Score that manifest themselves in varying ways. If you ever fall below the Light/Dark Points threshold for a Major tier, you immediately lose that tier's benefits. You regain the benefits when you meet the criteria again. Minor tier effects are permanent unless another similar effect occurs.\r\n\r\n#### Force Alignment\r\n| Alignment Score | Features |\r\n|:---:|:---|\r\n|100|Luminous Being (Major Benevolence Tier V)|\r\n| 90|Minor Benevolence (Tier V)|\r\n| 80|Major Benevolence (Tier IV)|\r\n| 70|Minor Benevolence (Tier IV)|\r\n| 60|Major Benevolence (Tier III)|\r\n| 50|Minor Benevolence (Tier III)|\r\n| 40|Major Benevolence (Tier II)|\r\n| 30|Minor Benevolence (Tier II)|\r\n| 20|Major Benevolence (Tier I)|\r\n| 10|Minor Benevolence (Tier I)|\r\n|  0|Balanced|\r\n| 10|Minor Corruption (Tier I)|\r\n| 20|Major Corruption (Tier I)|\r\n| 30|Minor Corruption (Tier II)|\r\n| 40|Major Corruption (Tier II)|\r\n| 50|Minor Corruption (Tier III)|\r\n| 60|Major Corruption (Tier III)|\r\n| 70|Minor Corruption (Tier IV)|\r\n| 80|Major Corruption (Tier IV)|\r\n| 90|Minor Corruption (Tier V)|\r\n|100|Dark Entity (Major Corruption Tier V)|\r\n\r\n### Minor Benevolence/Corruption\r\nAt certain tiers of Light/Dark Points, you risk manifesting Minor Traits, as shown in the Force Alignment table. When you would earn a Minor Trait, you must first make a saving throw (Charisma for Benevolence, Wisdom for Corruption), the DC of which varies depending on the tier of the Minor Trait, as shown in the Minor Benevolence/Corruption Save DC table below. On a failed save, you must roll on a Minor Benevolence/Corruption tables, depending on the tier of the Minor Benevolence/Corruption. You can choose to fail this saving throw, if you wish.\r\n\r\n##### Minor Benevolence/Corruption Save DC\r\n| Minor Benevolence/Corruption Tier | Save DC |\r\n|:--|:-:|\r\n| Minor Benevolence/Corruption (Tier I)     | 12 |\r\n| Minor Benevolence/Corruption (Tier II)    | 14 |\r\n| Minor Benevolence/Corruption (Tier III)   | 16 |\r\n| Minor Benevolence/Corruption (Tier IV)    | 18 |\r\n| Minor Benevolence/Corruption (Tier V)     | 20 |\r\n\r\n#### Minor Benevolence (Tier I)\r\n| d4 | Minor Benevolence|\r\n|:-:|:--|\r\n| 1 | Your eyes tend to brighten during moments of satisfaction. | \r\n| 2 | Your body is less likely to scar or show lasting signs of injury. | \r\n| 3 | Your voice becomes slightly more eloquent. | \r\n| 4 | Tame animals seem less uneasy around you.| \r\n\r\n#### Minor Benevolence (Tier II)\r\n| d4 | Minor Benevolence |  \r\n|:-:|:--|\r\n| 1 | Your eyes become more stark and vibrant. |\r\n| 2 | Any existing scars on your body fade, and wounds never scar or fester. | \r\n| 3 | Your voice gains a pleasant, melodic speaking cadence. | \r\n| 4 | Your hair gains subtle highlights of gold or silver that occasionally reflect light. | \r\n\r\n#### Minor Benevolence (Tier III)\r\n| d4 | Minor Benevolence | \r\n|:-:|:--|\r\n| 1 | Your eyes gain flecks of an unusual, complimenting color, such as amber or emerald. | \r\n| 2 | Your skin always has a healthy tone. | \r\n| 3 | You never suffer from minor illnesses, always appearing to be the pinnacle of health. | \r\n| 4 | Wild animals become significantly less prone to attacking you. | \r\n\r\n#### Minor Benevolence (Tier IV)\r\n| d4 | Minor Benevolence | \r\n|:-:|:--|\r\n| 1 | Your eyes permanently take on an unusual, complimenting color, such as green becoming bright emerald. | \r\n| 2 | Your voice has a naturally calming quality that puts others at easy. | \r\n| 3 | You seem all but immune to naturally occurring illnesses. | \r\n| 4 | Your hair takes on visible streaks of gold or silver. | Your hair begins to wither and fall out. |\r\n\r\n#### Minor Benevolence (Tier V)\r\n| d4 | Minor Benevolence | \r\n|:-:|:--|\r\n| 1 | Your eyes permanently gain a faint glow.| \r\n| 2 | You exude a calming presence that brings a slight feeling of peace to those around you. |\r\n| 3 | Withered or sickly plants seem to liven in your presence. |\r\n| 4 | You appear 1d10 years more youthful than you actually are. This does not change your actual life span.  | \r\n\r\n#### Minor Corruption (Tier I)\r\n| d4 | Minor Corruption|\r\n|:-:|:--|\r\n| 1 | Your eyes turn a pale yellow during moments of anger. |\r\n| 2 | You more easily become scarred. |\r\n| 3 | Your voice becomes slightly hoarse. |\r\n| 4 | Your hair starts to lose its color, with gray streaks appearing throughout it. |\r\n\r\n#### Minor Corruption (Tier II)\r\n| d4 | Minor Corruption |\r\n|:-:|:--|\r\n| 1 | Your eyes turn a luminous, sulfuric yellow with fiery red rims around the irises during moments of anger. |\r\n| 2 | Any scars on your body become more noticeable, and your wounds become more pronounced. |\r\n| 3 | Your voice lowers in pitch and becomes raspier. |\r\n| 4 | Your hair becomes predominantly gray. |\r\n\r\n#### Minor Corruption (Tier III)\r\n| d4 | Minor Corruption |\r\n|:-:|:--|\r\n| 1 | Your eyes permanently turn a luminous, sulfuric yellow with fiery red rings around the irises. |\r\n| 2 | Your skin begins to lose its pigmentation, becoming pale and mottled. |\r\n| 3 | Your veins become increasingly visible across your entire body, as if they are sticking out. |\r\n| 4 | Your hair loses its color entirely, turning a stark white. |\r\n\r\n#### Minor Corruption (Tier IV)\r\n| d4 | Minor Corruption |\r\n|:-:|:--|\r\n| 1 | Your eyes permanently turn a luminous, dark orange with fiery red rings around the irises. \r\n| 2 | Your skin loses its pigmentation, turning nearly stark white, while your veins become even more accentuated. |\r\n| 3 | Your nails and claws begin to wither and grow longer, turning a vile yellow color. |\r\n| 4 | Your hair begins to wither and fall out. |\r\n\r\n#### Minor Corruption (Tier V)\r\n| d4 | Minor Corruption |\r\n|:-:|:--|\r\n| 1 | Your eyes permanently turn a luminous, blood red with fiery red rings around the irises. |\r\n| 2 | You appear physically devoid of emotions. Your feelings never project outwards. |\r\n| 3 | You develop a sickly, uncontrollable cough. |\r\n| 4 | You appear 1d10 year older than you actually are. This does not change your actual life span. |\r\n\r\n### Major Benevolence\r\nAt certain tiers of Light Points, as shown in the Force Alignment table, you manifest a Major Benevolence.\r\n\r\n#### Tier I\r\nWhen you or an ally within 30 feet of you makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check to attempt to calm a creature or bring peace/alliance, you may spend a force point to add 1d4 to the result of the roll. \r\n\r\n#### Tier II\r\nWhen a friendly creature other than you within 30 feet that you can see fails a saving throw against being frightened, you can spend 1 force point to have them reroll the die. They must use the new roll.\r\n\r\n#### Tier III\r\nWhen an ally within 30 feet of you rolls a 1 on the d20 for an ability check or saving throw, you can spend 1 force point to let the ally reroll the die. They must use the new roll.\r\n\r\n#### Tier IV\r\nCasting light side force powers of 1st level or higher costs 1 fewer force point, but casting dark side powers of 1st level or higher costs 1 more.\r\n\r\n#### Luminous Being (Tier V)\r\nYou have become a physical manifestation of the light side of the Force, gaining one of the following boons. Your GM can choose the boon for you, or roll a die to determine it randomly.\r\n\r\n| d6 | Boon   |\r\n|:-:|:---|\r\n| 1 | Lightbringer |\r\n| 2 | Protection |\r\n| 3 | Immutable Defense | \r\n\r\n| d6 | Boon   |\r\n|:-:|:---|\r\n| 4 | Quick Casting |\r\n| 5 | Lay On Hands |\r\n| 6 | Healer |\r\n\r\n&emsp;***Lightbringer.*** Your maximum force points increases by 10.\r\n\r\n***Protection.*** When a friendly creature other than you within 30 feet that you can see takes damage from any source, you can reduce that damage to 0. Once you've used this boon, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Immutable Defense.*** The damage resistances of friendly creatures other than you within 30 feet of you cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\n***Quick Casting.*** Choose one light side force power you know of 1st through 3rd level that has a casting time of 1 action. That power's casting time is now 1 bonus action for you.\r\n\r\n***Lay On Hands.*** You can use a bonus action and touch a friendly creature other than yourself, causing them to recover a number of hit points equal to half their hit point maximum. Once you've used this boon, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n***Healer.*** If a friendly creature within 30 feet of you regains hit points at the end of a short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, that creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.\r\n\r\n### Major Corruption\r\nAt certain tiers of Dark Points, as shown in the Force Alignment table, you manifest a Major Corruption.\r\n\r\n#### Tier I\r\nYou have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks and disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made against creatures with a higher Wisdom score than you.\r\n\r\n#### Tier II\r\nYou have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, and disadvantage on saving throws against being charmed.\r\n\r\n#### Tier III\r\nYou have advantage on saving throws made against dark side force powers. Additionally, when you receive healing from light side force powers, you only regain half the amount of hit points.\r\n\r\n#### Tier IV\r\nCasting dark side force powers of 1st level or higher costs 1 fewer force point, but casting light side powers of 1st level or higher costs 1 more.\r\n\r\n#### Dark Entity (Tier V)\r\nYou have become a physical manifestation of the dark side of the Force, gaining one of the following boons. Your GM can choose the boon for you, or roll a die to determine it randomly.\r\n\r\n| d6 | Boon   |\r\n|:-:|:---|\r\n| 1 | Deathbringer |\r\n| 2 | Invincibility |\r\n| 3 | Irresistible Offense | \r\n\r\n| d6 | Boon   |\r\n|:-:|:---|\r\n| 4 | Quick Casting |\r\n| 5 | Recovery |\r\n| 6 | Power Mastery |\r\n\r\n&emsp;***Deathbringer.*** Your maximum force points increases by 10.\r\n\r\n***Invincibility.*** When you take damage from any source, you can reduce that damage to 0. Once you've used this boon, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n***Irresistible Offense.*** You can bypass the damage resistances of any creature.\r\n\r\n***Quick Casting.*** Choose one dark side force power you know of 1st through 3rd level that has a casting time of 1 action. That power's casting time is now 1 bonus action for you.\r\n\r\n***Recovery.*** You can use a bonus action to recover a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. Once you use this boon, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n***Power Mastery.*** Choose one 1st-level dark side power that you can cast. You can now cast that power at its lowest level without expending force points.\r\n\r\n## Destiny\r\n\r\nDestiny plays a large role in the *Star Wars* universe. As a young boy, Anakin Skywalker is told that his destiny is to bring about balance to the Force. Padme's destiny is to give birth to the twins, Luke and Leia, so that they can fulfil their own destinies. Luke Skywalker learns that his destiny is to redeem his father, Darth Vader, so that balance to the Force is restored. Leia's destiny is to save the Rebellion from annihilation at the hands of the Empire and help forge the New Republic. The destiny mechanic helps players and GMs recognize that all heroes - and even major villains - have significant roles to play in the fate of the galaxy. Destiny rewards players for good roleplaying and gives GM new plot hooks to use when designing adventures.\r\n\r\nThe rules presented below are optional. A GM may decide to use Destiny Points or not; however, the decision to use them should be made before the campaign gets underway, so that each player can decide whether or not to embrace a destiny for their character from the outset.\r\n\r\n### Choosing a Destiny\r\nPlayers don't need to choose destinies for their heroes at the start of the campaign - or ever for that matter. Not every hero has a destiny that must be fulfilled before the end of the campaign, and even players who want their characters to have destinies need to give their characters - and the campaign - a chance to develop first. It may take several adventures before players understand where the campaign is going and what goals their heroes are likely to pursue.\r\n\r\nChoosing a destiny can be handled in one of two ways: either the player can select an appropriate destiny for their hero (based on what's happening in the campaign), or the GM can select a secret destiny for the hero. If the player chooses a destiny for their character, the GM should challenge the player to fulfil their destiny by presenting conflicting situations where the smartest and most beneficial decision might force the character to choose between doing what is best for their fellow heroes and taking steps towards their destiny. If the GM secretly chooses the hero's destiny, they must present challenges that let the character move closer to achieving their destiny, imparting benefits when the character is moving in the right direction and imposing penalties when the character does something that takes them far from the destined path. The GM-selected \"secret destiny\" forces the player to take their character through a period of self-discovery, as they learn which action leads them closer to - or farther from - their destiny. In essence, this mirrors Luke Skywalker's struggle at the end of *The Empire Strikes Back*, when he must choose between redeeming his father and falling prey to the corruption of the dark side.\r\n\r\n&emsp;A character with a destiny gains short-term benefits whenever they make significant progress towards fulfilling it, while a character who pursues goals that move them further away from their destiny suffers short-term negative effects. Conversely, a character without a destiny has nothing to gain and nothing to lose. A character may even fulfill one destiny and take on another.\r\n\r\nThe GM and players should work together to determine a destiny's impact on a campaign. One or more destinies might form the driving force for an entire campaign, or the central focus of a short series of adventures. In one of these cases, the GM should present the characters with choices that regularly affect their destinies, giving them many opportunities to gain destiny bonuses and penalties. Destiny-based campaigns should culminate in a final adventure that allows characters to ultimately resolve their destinies, for better or for worse.\r\n\r\n### Destiny Points\r\nDestiny Points are a resource that a player can use to help fulfil whatever destiny has been set before their character. You either have a Destiny Point or you don't - you can't stockpile multiple Destiny Points for later use.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Bonus\r\nWhen a character accomplishes a goal or performs a task that clearly moves them closer to fulfilling their destiny (GM's determination), they gain a Destiny Point.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Penalty\r\nWhen a character does something that clearly moves them away from their destiny (GM's determination), they lose their Destiny Point if they currently have one. If not, the GM gains one Destiny Point to be used against them.\r\n\r\nIf the character makes steps towards their destiny once more, this GM Destiny Point should first be discarded instead of awarding the player with one.\r\n\r\n### Final Destiny\r\nWhen the moment or encounter of a character's final destiny is upon them (GM's determination) their Destiny Point is not expended upon use and may be used repeatedly. Examples of such a situation include Luke Skywalker at the Battle of Yavin, or Revan upon facing Darth Malak onboard the Star Forge.\r\n\r\n### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nWhen a character fulfils their destiny, they gain permanent benefits. Sometimes fulfilling a destiny has other effects as well; these are also covered here.\r\n\r\n### Spending Destiny Points\r\nSpending a Destiny Point does not take an action and grants one of the following benefits:\r\n* Gain advantage on an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.\r\n* Impose disadvantage on an enemy attack roll, saving throw, or ability check (even once the attack is resolved).\r\n* Act out of turn (thus changing your position in the initiative order).\r\n* Take damage that would otherwise harm another character within your reach.\r\n* Immediately gain 2 of a consumable class resource (rage, force points, tech points, superiority dice, or focus)\r\n\r\n### Sample Destinies\r\nThe following sample destinies should provide a starting point for any character wishing to take advantage of the destiny rules. Each destiny includes a brief description, with examples.\r\n\r\n### Champion\r\nYour destiny requires your to become leader of a large and/or significant group or organization and successfully lead it through an extremely threatening event. Characters who have this destiny might or might not know of the group they are destined to lead. They must attain this goal through a mixture of training, charisma, experience and political maneuvering. The GM might want to divide this into two destinies: attaining leadership and leading the group through troubled times.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include Mon Mothma leading the Rebel Alliance, Darth Sidious gaining control of the Republic, Wedge Antilles leading Rogue Squadron, and Admiral Ackbar escaping Grand Moff Tarkin and eventually taking command of the Rebel Fleet.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nYou receive a permanent 2 increase to your Charisma score.\r\n\r\n> ##### Sample Champion Destiny: Recruiting\r\n> Your destiny is to convince an influential person or group to secretly aid or openly join the resistance effort on a planet or in a sector. The person or group must have considerable authority and resources, and thus be able to operate behind a thick wall of underlings and bureacracy. The group might be a far-reaching criminal organization that has agents, established rackets, transports, and cover facilities throughout a sector. It could be a corporation that could lend its financial and material support to a local rebellion. Perhaps the hero encourages an influential military, government, or corporate leader currently serving the Empire to defect and aid the resistance. Convincing this entity to change its allied or neutral stance towards the Empire requires the hero to undertake missions to earn that individual's trust.\r\n\r\n### Corruption\r\nYour destiny is to corrupt an individual, organization, or location. You may seek to turn a person to the dark side or indoctrinate a group of people in the ways of evil. Your destiny may also be to become corrupted yourself, either by another character, an organisation, or a series of life-changing events that unfold over time. The corruption should be a long-term goal requiring a great deal of time and effort.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include the Emperor's corruption of Anakin Skywalker, a dark force-wielder transforming a Jedi shrine into a temple of evil, or an Imperial officer convincing an Alliance cell to betray the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a character's destiny may be to allow themselves to be corrupted by the dark side; their fall into darkness becomes the path to achieving this destiny.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nIncrease two ability scores of your choice by 1 each. In addition, if you are using the variant Dark Side Corruption rules, consult the Dark Side Corruption table.\r\n\r\n### Creation\r\nYour destiny requires you to create an object, machine, or other item of great power or significant use. You must use this item in support of another character's destiny, or in a future destiny of your own. Others might help create the actual item, so long as you lead and make a significant contribution to the effort. Pursuing this destiny might require you to seek out rare or restricted materials, expert advice, and adequate construction facilities or shops.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include Grand Moff Tarkin and the construction of the Death Star, Raith Sienar and the TIE fighter, and Walex Blissex and the *Victory*-class Star Destroyers.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nOnce per short rest, you or any ally within line of sight can take two actions in a single round while performing an action using the created object.\r\n\r\n### Destruction\r\nYour destiny is to destroy a person or object, for good or evil. A Rebel agent's destiny might be to destroy a tyrannical Imperial Moff presiding over his home planet, while a darkside may be destined to destroy a powerful Jedi training site used to bolster the ranks of the Jedi order. The target of this destiny should be something very difficult to reach, either because it's heavily guarded or well hidden. Example of this destiny include Darth Vader's destruction of the Emperor, Lando Calrissian's destruction of the Death Star II, or A-wing pilot Arvel Crynyd's destruction of the *Executor*.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nIncrease one ability score of your choice by +2.\r\n\r\n### Discovery\r\nYour destiny is to discover a person, species, object, or location that was either previously lost or unknown to the civilized galaxy. This could be as simple as seeking out the remains of a long-dead hero, or as rare as finding a vergence in the Force. A scout's destiny might be to find a thus-far-uncharted world that helps solve a galactic crisis, while a scoundrel's destiny might be to chart a new route through th Deep Core, allowing the Rebel Alliance to sneak past the Empire's security web. The thing being discovered should be something that can only be found as the result of a long-term search or serendipitous events that only occure because the character long ago set down the path that would lead to that discovery.\r\n\r\nExamples of thise destiny include Qui-Gon Jinn's discovery of Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine or Kyle Katarn's discovery of the Valley of the Jedi.\r\n\r\n> ##### Sample Discovery Destiny:\r\n> ##### Base of Resistance\r\n> Your destiny requires you to establish a hidden base that provides a safe haven and support for resistance fighters in a specific region. You might need to locate a new world that could accommodate a secret base or find a concealed facility on a known world from which dissenters covertly operate agains the Empire. You might need to gather allies and create secret support networks to maintain the base, supply it with equipment and weapons, and provide transportation for resistance forces. The scope of this destiny varies; it might be enough to establish a secret gathering place and a supply depot to aid resistance fighters in a single city, or it might require the construction of a major base to support operations in an entire system or even a sector.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nYou gain a permanent +1 destiny bonus to saving throws.\r\n\r\n### Education\r\nYour destiny is to train or educate another being or group of beings in some way. In some cases, this could mean taking a young Padawan learner and molding them into an eventual Jedi Master, or it could mean training fresh-faced Rebel Alliance recruits and molding them into a crack team of SpecForce operatives. Characters with this destiny are not merely teachers providing mundane training. The education that this destiny demands must be of great importance to the galaxy, and should lay the groundwork for the beneficiaries of your tutelage to go on to fulfil destinies of their own. Only when the training is complete can this destiny be fulfilled, and the process should take months or years to complete.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include Obi-Wan Kenobi's training of Anakin Skywalker, Yoda's training of Luke Skywalker, or Grand Admiral Thrawn's training of Captain Pellaeon.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nYou gain a permanent destiny bonus equal to your proficiency bonus on checks made with one class skill of your choice.\r\n\r\n### Liberation\r\nYour destiny is to liberate a group, population, or region from Imperial domination. The focus of this destiny can range from a persecuted group - a small alien enclave, a remote town, or an orbital installation - all the way to a city, a starport, or even an entire planet. For instance, a hero might endeavour to free a planet's governing legislature, which has been previously relocated to a well-guarded penal camp by a hard-line Imperial governor to silence its dissenting view. As another example, they could attempt to wrest control of a starship construction facility from the Empire by influencing the worker population to revolt, supplying arms and equipment, and leading them in a mutiny. Achieving this objective usually requires organizing resistance to Imperial forces that are persecuting the local populace, destroying key installations or assets, or deterring or eliminating personnel that are vital for the Empire to maintain its oppressive grip.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nYou gain a permanent +1 destiny bonus to saving throws.\r\n\r\n### Redemption\r\nYour destiny is to redeem a character that has been corrupted or otherwise turned to evil. Many Jedi seek to turn their fallen brethren away from the dark side. A Rebel agent might seek to turn his brother, an Imperial officer, away from the evil Empire, redeeming him back to the side of justice and freedom. The target of this destiny should be someone that has fallen from the light in some way, whether that means turning to the dark side of the Force or simply siding with evil over good. Turning someone away from their wicked ways is usually very difficult and requires far more than simple persuasion. Often a a character that fulfills this destiny does not survive it, and sometimes neither does their redeemed target. Aditionally, you may be your own target for this destiny, making your own redemption the means of fulfilling it.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include Luke Skywalker turning Darth Vader away from the dark side and Revan's redemption of Bastila Shan on the Star Forge.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nYou receive a permanent 2 increase to your Wisdom score. In addition, the Corruption score of the redeemed character is reduced to 1 and they lose any dark side corruptions they have accrued.\r\n\r\n### Rescue\r\nYour destiny requires you to save a person from death or an object from destruction. Often characters with this destiny will not know which person or object they're meant to save, let alone when or how to do so. They simply must be in the right place at the right time. A hero might spend months travelling with his allies before fulfilling his destiny by saving one of their lives. Conversely, a Rebel agent might engage in years' worth of espionage on his home planet, only to find that his destiny is to save a local Imperial magistrate who betrays the Empire after having her life saved.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include Han Solo saving Luke Skywalker's life at the Battle of Yavin and Wicket the Ewok rescuing Leia from the scout troopers on Endor.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nIncrease two ability score of your choice by 1 each.\r\n\r\n### Death and Destiny\r\nAchieving one's destiny may yield great benefits, but the path of destiny can be perilous. Many characters in the *Star Wars* saga perish attempting to fulfil their destinies. If a Force-sensitive character dies while fulfilling (or attempting to fulfil) their destiny, the GM may allow the dead character to manifest as a Force spirit. If a non-force-wielder perishes while pursuing or achieving his destiny, the GM may decide that the character's sacrifice or untimely death imparts some benefit upon his surviving allies.\r\n\r\n**Force Spirit.** A force-wielder who dies in the process of fulfilling his destiny may manifest as a Force spirit. For a light side force-wielder, this means transforming into a translucent blue spirit that can appear before his former allies. For a dark side force-wielder, this means becoming an evil dark side spirit that can linger on, continuing to spread the influence of the dark side.\r\n\r\nIf a Force sensitive character dies while fulfilling their destiny, that character may become a Force spirit, retaining their consciousness (and their Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores) but becoming completely incorporeal. The Force spirit can menifest at will and can vanish just as easily. It can also walk through walls and exist in the vacuum of space. Additionally, Force spirits can travel anywhere in the galaxy instantly with a mere thought. However, Force spirits have no substance and cannot interact physically with creatures or objects in the universe.\r\n\r\nWhen a hero dies and becomes a Force spirit, that Force spirit might serves as a guide, advising heroes in times of dire need and sharing valuable information or wisdom it held in life.\r\n\r\n**Noble Sacrifice.** Whenever a character willingly sacrifices himself for a noble cause, particularly while fulfilling his destiny he can bolster the resolve of his surviving comrades and allies. For example, when Arvel Crynyd crashed his A-wing into the bridge of the Executor, it was a turning point in the Battle of Endor. When a character dies fulfilling his destiny in such a way, all allies within the same star system gain one destiny point.\r\n\r\n&emsp;**Vengeance.** When a valued ally falls in the pursuit of his destiny, it can have powerful effects on those present at the time of his death. When a character dies fulfilling his destiny, any ally who witnesses his death may choose to become filled with a desire to avenge their fallen comrade, gaining a destiny point. Since revenge leads to the dark side, any force-wielder who chooses to gain this bonus must immediately increase his Corruption score by 1.\r\n\r\n## Starship Destiny\r\n\r\nSometimes a starship is more than just a means of transportation. Sometimes, it's part of a character's destiny. In fact, for some characters, it's the focal point of their destiny, which might otherwise be nothing more than to wander aimlessly from one jam to another. No matter how humble (or downright ramschackle) a starship might appear, if it's the destiny of a character to be linked with that ship, it can accomplish amazing things.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to link a starship (or, rarely, a planetary vehicle) to your destiny, that replaces the normal destiny mechanic. In essence, you don't have a destiny to accomplish any specific goal; instead, you're destined have the most important events in your life with a specific starship. This option is appropriate in campaigns with at least a moderate frequency of starship-scale encounters, but it's certainly not restricted to such campaigns. In fact, if a campaign centers exclusively around starship-scale action, this option might be too powerful as it allows access to Destiny Points in most encounters. Only the GM can decide if starship-linked destinies are appropriate for a given campaign.\r\n\r\nYou earn and spend Destiny Points with a starship-linked destiny using the same basic rules as with the normal destiny options. However, having your destiny linked to a starship causes the rules to work slightly differently.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Destiny Points are earned when you experience (and survive) key campaign events involving you and your starship.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if a starship is your destiny, it is never completely destroyed. Even if it is blown up in battle or confiscated by Hutts before being crushed and melted, some small part of it survives. Perhaps you find the hyperspace core the whole starship was built around, or its ruined hull is found drifting as debris after that battle. Your starship can cease to be functional as easily as anyone else's, but a recognizable part of it always survives for you to rebuild (or retrofit to a similar starship). It can be as time consuming and difficult as getting a new starship would be (if not more so), but the result still qualifies as your destiny-linked starship.\r\n\r\nFinally, the options you can exercise by using a Destiny Point are slightly different, as detailed below. The following are possible only when you are acting as a crew member (pilot, gunner, mechanic, operator or coordinator) on the starship linked to your destiny:\r\n\r\n- Cause an attack rolled against your starship to suffer disadvantage, or gain advantage on a saving throw against an attack on your starship, even once the attack is resolved. (Coordinator or pilot)\r\n- Gain advantage on any pilot check. (Pilot)\r\n- Allow your starship to act out of turn, thus changing your position in the initiative order. (Coordinator, operator, or pilot)\r\n- Gain advantage on an attack roll, or impose disadvantage on an enemy saving throw, against an attack from your ship's weapons. (Coordinator, gunner, or operator)\r\n- Repair your starship, restoring hit points by rolling a number of its hit die equal to or less than your level. (Mechanic)\r\n- Immediately restore your starship's shields to full. (Mechanic or operator)\r\n- Gain advantage on any skill check made to interact with the ship.\r\n- Immediately gain 2 tactical dice.\r\n\r\nIn general, a character with a starship-linked destiny can do what no one else can manage - unless they, too, are linked to its destiny. There's nothing to prevent multiple characters from being destiny-linked to the same starship. Such characters might share the ship, or might constantly be stealing, buying or gambling it back and forther between them.\r\n\r\n## Weapon Sundering\r\n\r\nYou can attempt to damage, and potentially destroy, a weapon held by a hostile creature. On your turn, you can take the Sundering action to damage an enemy's weapon. Make a melee weapon attack roll with disadvantage against the target's Armor Class as normal. If the attack hits, roll weapon damage and instead apply the damage to one weapon being wielded by your target.\r\n\r\n### Weapon Hit Dice and Hit Points\r\nA weapon's hit points are presented both as Hit Dice and hit points. A weapon has a number of Hit Dice equal to twice its damage dice. For instance, a blaster rifle has a 1d8 damage die, so it has 2 Hit Dice, which are d8s. A weapon's hit points are determined by taking the average of its hit dice. For instance, a blaster has 2 Hit Dice, which are d8s, so it has 9 hit points on average, as shown in the Hit Dice Average table below.\r\n\r\n#### Hit Dice Average\r\n|Hit Die|Average Hit Points per Hit Die|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|d4|2.5|\r\n|d6|3.5|\r\n|d8|4.5|\r\n|d10|5.5|\r\n|d12|6.5|\r\n\r\nAt the GM's discretion, some weapons might be resistant, immune, or even vulnerable to certain types of damage. Enhanced weapons are resistance, or even immune, to damage from unenhanced weapons.\r\n\r\n### Repairing Damaged/Broken Weapons\r\nA weapon is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. As long as a weapon has 1 or more hit points remaining, a character can attempt to perform minor repairs by spending one or more of the weapon's Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the weapon's maximum number of Hit Dice. To restore hit dice, the player must first make an Intelligence (Technology) check\r\nIf a weapon has at least 1 HP remaining, you can attempt to make minor repairs to it during a Short Rest. To attempt to restore HD, a character must make an Intelligence (Technology) roll. The DC is 8 + the amount of damage the weapon has taken. The player has advantage on the roll if they know the *mending* tech power or are proficient with the appropriate artisan's tools (armstech's tools for blasters and vibroweapons, artificer's tools for lightweapons). On a failure, the Hit Die is expended and no hit points are restored. On a success, the player can spend the weapon's Hit Dice to restore hit points. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.\r\n\r\nA weapon regains Hit Dice when serviced by a professional with the appropriate artisan's tools, who can repair the weapon over a number of hours equal to the size of the weapon's damage dice. For instance, a blaster rifle has a 1d8 damage die, so it would take 8 hours to repair. This service costs half the value of the weapon.\r\n\r\n> In reality, lightweapons are probably more effective than vibroweapons when it comes to sundering weapons. For the sake of balance, they aren't. At the GM's discretion, weapons might be resistant to kinetic damage, or vulnerable to energy damage, to represent this effectiveness.\r\n\r\nA player can choose to specialize their character with the following features.\r\n\r\n### Fighting Style\r\nCertain class features or feats offer your choice of Fighting Style. As a part of this variant rule, you should allow your players to take the following Fighting Style instead of the options listed in the Player Handbook. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\r\n\r\n#### Sunder Fighting\r\nYou are skilled at striking in order to damage, and potentially destroy, your enemies' weapons. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- You no longer have disadvantage on Sundering attack rolls.\r\n- When a foe hits you with a Sundering attack, you can use your reaction to add a +5 to your armor class vs the triggering attack. If this causes the attack to miss, your weapon does not take any damage.\r\n\r\n### Fighting Mastery\r\nA feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise. As a part of this variant rule, you should allow your players to take the following feat instead of the options listed in the Player Handbook.\r\n\r\n#### Sundering Mastery\r\nYou have mastered rending your foes' weapons, leaving them impotent and vulnerable to your follow up attacks. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Before you make a Sundering attack with weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add double your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.\r\n- On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a Sundering attack or reduce a weapon to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.\r\n\r\n## Dismemberment\r\n\r\nSome characters\ufffdand their players\ufffdtake great pleasure in using their weapons to potentially maim their foes. If you want to add an additional layer to combat, consider using this variant rule.\r\n\r\nWhen a character scores a critical hit with a weapon that is capable of removing a limb, such as a lightweapon or vibroweapon, have them roll an additional d20. If they roll a 20 on the second d20 roll, they successfully remove a limb from a creature, or potentially slay the creature outright.\r\n\r\nThe character should then roll percentile dice and consult the Dismemberment table below.\r\n\r\n##### Dismemberment\r\n\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|&nbsp;01-&nbsp;40|You remove a hand. If the creature has more than one hand, determine which hand you cut off randomly.|\r\n|&nbsp;41-&nbsp;70|You remove both hands. If the creature has more than two hands, determine which hands you cut off randomly.|\r\n|&nbsp;71-&nbsp;90|You remove a leg. The creature's speed is halved if it has at least one more leg. Otherwise, its speed is reduced to 0 and it is knocked prone.|\r\n|&nbsp;91-&nbsp;98|You remove both legs. If the creature has more than two legs, its speed is halved. Otherwise, its speed is reduced to 0 and it is knocked prone.|\r\n|&nbsp;99-&nbsp;100|You remove a head. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head.|\r\n\r\nIf a creature is immune to the damage dealt by the weapon, it can not be dismembered by that weapon. If the creature is resistant to the damage dealt by that weapon, when you roll the second d20 to determine whether or not you remove a limb, you do so with disadvantage.\r\n\r\nIf you roll a result on the Dismemberment table, and the creature lacks the chosen limb, you instead deal additional damage equal to the attack's governing ability modifier. \r\n\r\nA creature with legendary actions can use its Legendary Resistance to avoid dismemberment, instead taking the additional damage equal to the attack's governing ability modifier.\r\n\r\n> ##### More Common Dismemberment\r\n> You can readily increase the potential for this rule through a number of house corrections. As it stands, not account for advantage/disadvantage, you have a 1/400 (or .25%) chance to trigger a dismemberment when you make an attack roll. This increases to 39/8,000 with advantage (or .4875%), almost doubling the potential. You can increase it even more by changing the initial trigger to any critical hit, instead of just a natural 20, or increasing the range on the additional d20 from beyond just a natural 20, or both.\r\n\r\n## Defense Rolls\r\n\r\nOne of the first variant rules I added to my games was the Defense Rolls, published in the Unearthed Arcana: Variant Rules. Essentially, instead of the GM making attack rolls against the players' static AC, the players make defense rolls against the GM's static attack save DC. Implementing this is easy.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Defense Bonus (DB)\r\nArmor class is replaced with Defense Bonus. This bonus is calculated simply by players taking their AC and subtracting 10. If a player had an AC of 16, they would have a DB of +6.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Attack Save DC\r\nAttack bonuses you find on monster cards are similar converted to static values, called the attack save DC. To calculate this DC, simply take the listed attack bonus and add 12 to it. For instance, a B1 battle droid's blaster rifle attacks with a +4 modifier. Instead, that droid would have an attack save DC of 16.\r\n\r\n### Making the Roll\r\nInstead of the GM making attack rolls, players make defense rolls by rolling a d20 and adding their Defense Bonus. If the roll meets or exceeds the attack save DC, the player successfully defends. If a character fails the the defense roll, the attack hits.\r\n\r\nIf the attacker would normally have advantage on the attack roll, you instead apply disadvantage to the defense roll, and vice versa if the attacker would have disadvantage.\r\n\r\nIf the defense roll comes up a 1 on the d20, then the attack is a critical hit. If the attacker would normally score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, then the attack is a critical hit on a 1 or 2, and so forth for broader critical ranges.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a 20 on the defense roll would automatically be a successful dodge, regardless of the attack save DC.\r\n\r\n## Saving Throw Checks\r\n\r\nAlso published in the Unearthed Arcana: Variant Rules was a rule for your players to roll when they use powers or abilities that call for a save DC. Instead of the GM making saving throws against the players' static save DCs, the players roll a saving throw check against the GM's defense save DC.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Saving Throw Check\r\nIf players have their save throw DCs calculated, simply subtract 8 from that value. If your consular's force save DC is 15, your saving throw check modifier is +7.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Defense Save DC\r\nMonster cards also include potential saving throws, which can easily be converted to a defense save DC. Take the appropriate ability score modifier and add 14 to it. If the monster is proficient in the saving throw (indicated in the *saving throw* line on the monster card, if it exists), instead use that value. For instance, if a B1 battle droid is forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, its defense save DC would be 16 (14+2).\r\n\r\n### Making the Roll\r\nInstead of the GM rolling saving throws for the monsters, players make saving throw checks by rolling a d20 and adding their saving throw check modifier. If the roll meets or exceeds the defense save DC, the creature fails the saving throw. If a character fails the the saving throw check, the creature successfully saves.\r\n\r\nIf the defender would normally have advantage on the saving roll, you instead apply disadvantage to the saving throw check, and vice versa if the defender would have disadvantage.\r\n\r\n## Simplified Forcecasting\r\n\r\nThe current version of the SW5e PHB has the player using different ability scores depending on the alignment of the powers they are trying to cast: Wisdom for light side, Charisma for dark side, player's choice for universal.\r\n\r\nFor new players, this might be too complicated. Consider letting them instead choose between using Wisdom and Charisma as their forcecasting ability.\r\n\r\n## Force and Tech Prowess\r\n\r\nWhen you fail an ability check, if you added your proficiency bonus to the check and you did not have advantage or disadvantage, you can spend 1 force or tech point to reroll the die. You can only use this feature once per ability check, and you must use the new roll.\r\n\r\n## ASI and a Feat\r\n\r\nThis one is simple. At level 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, when a player gets the opportunity to choose between adding 2 to their ability scores or a feat, I'm letting them add 1 to an ability score *and* choose a feat.\r\n\r\nNow, this is going to create more powerful players, which means you need to pit them against more powerful monsters. I, personally, love this rule because I know it helps experienced players realize the exact character they want and helps to differentiate different characters of the same class. Then again, I'm a *huge* proponent of feats in general.\r\n\r\n## Milestone Leveling\r\n\r\nI won't delve too far into this. The simplified version is that instead of receiving experience for every encounter and leveling up at odd times, the GM chooses when they level up. Additionally, there never has the potential to be an experience, and consequently level, disparity between players.\r\n\r\n## Bonus Action Consumables\r\n\r\nMost consumables require an action to use, which makes sense when applying them to others. However, a common adjustment in 5e (which is even more logical in SW5e), is to allow administering such consumables to yourself as a bonus action, instead. This only applies to consumables that confer a positive benefit, such as a repair kit or medpac.\r\n\r\n## Hunted\r\n\r\nIn some eras of Star Wars history, forcecasters are a rarity, and are hunted across the galaxy by the likes of Inquisitors, or if they're unlucky, a Dark Lord of the Sith, in an attempt to crush any foreseen threats to their rule. Should you want your forcecasting players to experience this additional level of drama and suspense, here is an alternate rule to implement:\r\n\r\nWhenever a player casts a force power, others in the Galaxy may detect their presence through ripples in the Force. Each player has a pool of Disturbance Points. This pool of Disturbance Points increases every time a force power is cast by a number of points equal to the level of the force power used (at-will powers are treated as Level 0). \r\n\r\nAfter each combat, roll a percentile dice for each player that used a force power. If you roll a number equal to or lower than the players Disturbance Pool, they are detected by Jedi Hunters of your determination, who begin to hunt the player they detected.\r\n\r\nDuring each long rest, decrease each player's pool of Disturbance Points by an amount equal to their level.",
