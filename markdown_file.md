> ___
> ***Creature Sense.*** The bor is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creatureâs intelligence score, but it canât sense anything else about it. Droids and creatures protected by a mind blank power or other similar effect cannot be perceived in this manner.
>
> ***Fortified Mind.*** The bor has advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened, and it canât be put to sleep.
>
> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the bor fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ***Psychic Link.*** The bor can establish a psychic link with any creature that it successfully grapples with its tentacles. Until the psychic link ends, the bor can perceive everything the target senses. The target is aware that its mind is linked, and the bor can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link with a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The psychic link also ends if the target and the bor are more than 1 mile apart, with no consequences to the target. The bor can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.

> ***Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** The bor emits a wave of psychic energy. Creatures of the bor's choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 32 (5d10+5) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> ***Mental Plunder.*** The bor targets a creature it is linked to. The bor gains insight into the target's emotional state and any thoughts that loom large in its mind (including worries, loves, and hates). The bor can also make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage against the target's Wisdom (Insight) to deceive the target's mind into believing one idea or feeling a particular emotion. On a success, the target believes the deception for 1 hour or until evidence of the lie is presented to it.
> ### LEGENDARY ACTIONS
> The bor can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The bor regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn.

> ***Enter Orifice.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4+2) kinetic damage.
>
> ***Consume Mind.*** The brain worm targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw against this power or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. Also on a failure, roll 3d6: If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it regains at least one point of Intelligence.
>
> ***Body Thief.*** The brain worm initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. If it wins the contest, the brain worm burrows into the target's brain and takes control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the brain worm has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The brain worm retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Geonosian, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including force powers, tech powers, and languages. If the host body takes 20 points of cold damage in a single round, the brain worm must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw using its own Constitution score, not the host's. On a failure, the brain worm leaves the body, slithering out to a space within 5 feet of the host. After exiting the host, it is paralyzed until the start of its next turn. If the host body dies, the brain worm must leave it. The brain worm is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a master heal force power. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the brain worm can voluntarily leave the body, slithering out to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it.

Each creature there must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) sonic damage and be flung up to 60 feet in a direction away from the line. If a thrown target collides with an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) kinetic damage for every 10 feet it was thrown before impact. If the target would collide with another creature, the other creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take an equal amount of kinetic damage and be knocked prone.

> ***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.
>
> ***Dark Venom.*** Hssiss venom is potent and imbued with the dark side. At the end of a long rest, a creature poisoned by the Hssiss must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the poison is cured. The creature recovers from the poison by making two consecutive successful saving throws. A force-based *Improved Restoration* power cures the poison, while *Restoration* gives the creature advantage on the next saving throw. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
>
> ***Disruptive.*** When a creature is forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage from the dragon, the DC for the check equals 10 or the full damage taken, whichever number is higher, instead of only half.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the Hssiss can't bite another target.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6+4) kinetic damage. The creature must then succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned and take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

A creature whose space the droid enters must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 5 feet to the nearest space out of the droid's path . On a failed save, the creature falls prone and takes 28 (8d6) kinetic damage. If the droid remains in the prone creature's space, the creature is also restrained until it's no longer in the same space as the droid. While restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 17 Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the droid and is no longer restrained.

> ___
> ***Innate Forcecasting.*** Abelothâs forcecasting ability is Charisma (force save DC 23). Abeloth can innately cast the following force powers: <br>
>
> At-will: *coerce mind, sense force* <br>
1/day each: *telekinetic wave, force lightning cone* <br>
3/day each: *fear, force suppression, telekinesis* <br>
>
> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Abeloth fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ***Force Resistance.*** Abeloth has advantage on saving throws against force powers and other effects.
>
> ***Enhanced Being.*** Abelothâs weapon attacks are considered enhanced for the purposes of overcoming resistances.
>
> ***One with the Force.*** Abeloth has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, stunned, or knocked unconscious.
>
> ***Willful Gaze.*** Unless suprised or incapacitated, a creature targeted by one of Abeloth's Will effects can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw. If the creature does so, it can't see Abeloth until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Abeloth in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The Abeloth makes two tentacle attacks.
>
> ***Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (3d12+9) kinetic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the target's hit point maximum is reduced to 0, it dies and its essence is absorbed into Abeloth.
>
> ***Beguiling Will.*** Abeloth exerts its will on one creature it can see within 120 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saved, the target is stunned until the start of Abeloth's next turn.
>
> ***Hypnotic Will.*** Abeloth exerts its will on one creature it can see within 120 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is charmed. Abeloth chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement. While Abeloth has a creature charmed in this way, it can't use any of its Will actions until the effect ends. The effect lasts until the start of Abeloth's next turn, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a power).
>
> ***Insane Will.*** Abeloth exerts its will on one creature it can see within 120 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overcome with insanity. While under this effect, a creature can't take reactions and must roll a d8 at the start of its turn to determine its behavior for that turn. On a roll of a 1, the creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction and doesnât take any actions that turn. On a 2-6, the creature doesn't move and takes no actions that turn. On a 7-8, the creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing that turn. This effect lasts until the start of Abeloth's next turn.
> ### Legendary Actions
> The Manifestation of Abeloth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Manifestation of Abeloth regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn.
>
> ***Draining Lightning.*** *Ranged Power Attack:* +17 to hit, range 15 ft., *Hit:* 20 (2d10+9) lightning damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage.
>
> ***Maddening Will.*** Abeloth uses a Will action.

The deflector has 80 hit points. Whenever the droideka takes damage other than ion or lightning, the shield takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the shield to 0 hit points, the droideka takes any remaining damage. The droideka can deactivate the shield (no action required). When deactivated the shield regenerates 10 hit points at the end of the droideka's turn. The shield shuts down and cannot be activated when in ball form.

>
> ***Stench.*** Any creature other than a ng'ok that starts its turn within 5 feet of the ng'ok must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all ng'oks for 1 hour.
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The ng'ok makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8+3) kinetic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

> ***Grapple Slam.*** The ng'ok slams creatures grappled by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (2d6+3) kinetic damage and be stunned until the end of the ng'ok's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the kinetic damage and isn't stunned.

>
> ***Crushing Stride.*** The droid moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. A creature whose space the droid enters must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls prone and takes 36 (8d8) kinetic damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is pushed 5 feet to the nearest space out of the droid's path. If the droid ends its movement in a prone creature's space, the creature is also restrained until it's no longer in the same space as the droid. While restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the droid and is no longer restrained.
>
> ***Ram.*** The droid moves up to its speed in a straight line towards a structure or construct. A structure or construct whose space the droid ends its turn adjacent must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the structure or construct takes 70 (10d12+5) kinetic damage, or half as much on a success. The droid takes damage equal to half the damage dealt.

>
> ***Ultimate Mutation.*** The Eyeless is the peak of rakghoul mutation. Once per round when a creature infected with the rakghoul plague enters the area within 30 feet of the Eyeless for the first time, it must roll its saving throw against the Plague or immediately advance to the next stage of infection.
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The Eyeless uses its Infected Phlegm, then uses its Crush if available, or makes three slam attacks.
>
> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8+8) kinetic damage. If the target is a humanoid creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the Rakghoul Plague.

On a success, a creature takes half damage and doesn't fall prone.
>
> ***Infected Phlegm.*** The Eyeless spits out a deluge of sickly green mucus at three points of its choice within 60 feet of it, each splashing down in a 10-foot radius around the point. Each creature in an affected area must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) acid damage and be coated in slime. A creature coated in this slime gains one level of the slowed condition, and when it makes a saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the total. For each coating of slime affecting a creature, it gains an additional level of slowed and the d4 roll increases by 1d4. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't slimed. A creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success. A creature in the area of more than one deluge of mucus is only affected once. A creature affected by three coatings of slime is automatically infected with Rakghoul Plague.
> ### Legendary Actions
> The Rakghoul, Eyeless can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Rakghoul, Eyeless regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn.

While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the rancor, and it takes 35 (10d6) acid damage at the start of each of the rancor's turns. If the rancor takes 35 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Rancor must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the Rancor. If the Rancor dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
